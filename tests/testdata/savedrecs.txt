Results indicate that it is possible to obtain around 50% reduction of perplexity by using mixture of several RNN LMs, compared to a state of the art backoff language model. Speech recognition experiments show around 18% reduction of word error rate on the Wall Street Journal task when comparing models trained on the same amount of data, and around 5% on the much harder NIST RT05 task, even when the backoff model is trained on much more data than the RNN LM. We provide ample empirical evidence to suggest that connectionist language models are superior to standard n-gram techniques, except their high computational (training) complexity.

This paper presents Articulate, an attempt at a semi-automated visual analytic model that is guided by a conversational user interface to allow users to verbally describe and then manipulate what they want to see. We use natural language processing and machine learning methods to translate the imprecise sentences into explicit expressions, and then apply a heuristic graph generation algorithm to create a suitable visualization. The goal is to relieve the user of the burden of having to learn a complex user-interface in order to craft a visualization.

It is often unclear which exact time interval a temporal expression refers to.

Information systems are needed to manage a representation of the user's situation, identify user needs and preferences, and implement information retrieval techniques that pull together data from diverse and heterogeneous sources. It is necessary to define and formalize context models for achieving these goals. In this paper, we present a formal context model based on advances on the Semantic Web. The model is compounded by four independent and related ontologies: users, devices, environment and services. Each of these ontologies describes general concepts and relationships involved in intelligent environments. The proposed design enables model specializations to particular domains and interoperability with external ontologies. Moreover, the model supports inference mechanisms to enhance the automatic context generation and the proactive behavior of particular services. Finally, this paper shows a specific prototype that offers personalized and context-aware information to the user, aided by the context model.

We first assess the extent to which each of these accounts can explain the level of OI errors across five different languages (English, Dutch, German, French and Spanish). We then differentiate between the two accounts by testing their predictions about the relation between children's 01 errors and the distribution of infinitival verb forms in the input language. We conclude that, although both accounts fit the cross-linguistic patterning of OI errors reasonably well, only MOSAIC is able to explain why verbs that occur more frequently as infinitives than as finite verb forms in the input also occur more frequently as OI errors than as correct finite verb forms in the children's output.

What is evident nowadays, instead, is that architectural languages are defined by stakeholder concerns. Capturing all such concerns within a single, narrowly focused notation is impossible. At the same time, it is also impractical to define and use a ""universal"" notation, such as UML. As a result, many domain-specific notations for architectural modeling have been proposed, each one focusing on a specific application domain, analysis type, or modeling environment. As a drawback, a proliferation of languages exists, each one with its own specific notation, tools, and domain specificity. No effective interoperability is possible to date. Therefore, if a software architect has to model a concern not supported by his own language/tool, he has to manually transform (and, eventually, keep aligned) the available architectural specification into the required language/tool. This paper presents DUALLY, an automated framework that allows architectural languages and tools interoperability. Given a number of architectural languages and tools, they can all interoperate thanks to automated model transformation techniques. DUALLY is implemented as an Eclipse plugin. Putting it in practice, we apply the DUALLY approach to the Darwin/FSP ADL and to a UML2.0 profile for software architectures. By making use of an industrial complex system, we transform a UML software architecture specification in Darwin/FSP, make some verifications by using LTSA, and reflect changes required by the verifications back to the UML specification."

J	Ansaldo, AI; Saidi, LG; Ruiz, A				Ansaldo, Ana Ines; Saidi, Ladan Ghazi; Ruiz, Adelaida			Model-driven intervention in bilingual aphasia: Evidence from a case of pathological language mixing	APHASIOLOGY			English	Article						Bilingual aphasia; Intervention; Model-based; Pathological switching	NAMING TREATMENT; RECOVERY; THERAPY; SPEECH; BRAIN; FMRI	Background: Speech-language pathologists are meeting an increasing number of bilingual clients. This poses a special challenge to clinical practice, given that bilingualism adds to the complexity of aphasia patterns and clinical decisions must be made accordingly. One question that has come to the attention of clinical aphasiologists is that of the language in which therapy should be administered. This issue becomes particularly relevant in cases of involuntary language switching, when choosing between L1 and L2 implies inhibiting one of the languages. Models of lexical selection in bilingual people offer a rationale for language choice based on the specificities of bilingual aphasia within each client. Aims: To provide evidence for model-based intervention in bilingual aphasia, particularly in cases of pathological language switching. Methods Procedures: This paper reports a model-driven intervention in a case of involuntary language switching following aphasia in a Spanish-English bilingual client. Outcomes Results: Intervention tailored to the client's strengths resulted in improved communication skills thanks to the implementation of a self-regulated strategy to overcome involuntary language switching. Conclusions: Model-driven descriptions of bilingual aphasia contribute to efficient intervention by identifying therapy approaches that take account of each client's language abilities. Further, clinical data analysed within models of bilingual language processing can provide evidence for dissociations between components of the bilingual lexical system.

Predicting Language Improvement in Acute Stroke Patients Presenting with Aphasia: A Multivariate Logistic Model Using Location-Weighted Atlas-Based Analysis of Admission CT Perfusion Scans	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							RECOVERY; PENUMBRA	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Prediction of functional outcome immediately after stroke onset can guide optimal management. Most prognostic grading scales to date, however, have been based on established global metrics such as total NIHSS score, admission infarct volume, or intracranial occlusion on CTA. Our purpose was to construct a more focused, location-weighted multivariate model for the prediction of early aphasia improvement, based not only on traditional clinical and imaging parameters, but also on atlas-based structure/function correlation specific to the clinical deficit, using CT perfusion imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-eight consecutive patients with aphasia due to first-time ischemic stroke of the left hemisphere were included. Language function was assessed on the basis of the patients admission and discharge NIHSS scores and clinical records. All patients had brain CTP and CIA within 9 hours of symptom onset. For image analysis, all CTPs were automatically coregistered to MNI-152 brain space and parcellated into mirrored cortical and subcortical regions. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to find independent imaging and clinical predictors of language recovery. RESULTS: By the time of discharge, 21 (36%) patients demonstrated improvement of language. Independent factors predicting improvement in language included rCBF of the angular gyrus GM (BA 3 9) and the lower third of the insular ribbon, proximal cerebral artery occlusion on admission CTA, and aphasia score on the admission NIHSS examination. Using these 4 variables, we developed a multivariate logistic regression model that could estimate the probability of early improvement in aphasia and predict functional outcome with 91% accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: An imaging-based location-weighted multivariate model was developed to predict early language improvement of patients with aphasia by using admission data collected within 9 hours of stroke onset. This pilot model should be validated in a larger, prospective study; however, the semiautomated atlas-based analysis of brain CTP, along with the statistical approach, could be generalized for prediction of other outcome measures in patients with stroke.

Words as alleles: connecting language evolution with Bayesian learners to models of genetic drift	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						language evolution; genetic drift; Bayesian inference; neutral models	FREQUENCY-DISTRIBUTIONS; COMMUNICATION; POPULATIONS; ACQUISITION; DYNAMICS; CULTURE	Scientists studying how languages change over time often make an analogy between biological and cultural evolution, with words or grammars behaving like traits subject to natural selection. Recent work has exploited this analogy by using models of biological evolution to explain the properties of languages and other cultural artefacts. However, the mechanisms of biological and cultural evolution are very different: biological traits are passed between generations by genes, while languages and concepts are transmitted through learning. Here we show that these different mechanisms can have the same results, demonstrating that the transmission of frequency distributions over variants of linguistic forms by Bayesian learners is equivalent to the Wright-Fisher model of genetic drift. This simple learning mechanism thus provides a justification for the use of models of genetic drift in studying language evolution. In addition to providing an explicit connection between biological and cultural evolution, this allows us to define a 'neutral' model that indicates how languages can change in the absence of selection at the level of linguistic variants. We demonstrate that this neutral model can account for three phenomena: the s-shaped curve of language change, the distribution of word frequencies, and the relationship between word frequencies and extinction rates.

J	van Heuven, WJB; Dijkstra, T				van Heuven, Walter J. B.; Dijkstra, Ton			Language comprehension in the bilingual brain: fMRI and ERP support for psycholinguistic models	BRAIN RESEARCH REVIEWS			English	Review						Bilingualism; Language processing; fMRI; ERP; BIA plus model; Psycholinguistic model	VISUAL WORD RECOGNITION; INTERLINGUAL HOMOGRAPHS; CORTICAL ACTIVATION; ENGLISH BILINGUALS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL MRI; WORKING-MEMORY; NEURAL BASIS; EXECUTIVE CONTROL; SENTENCE CONTEXT	In this paper, we review issues in bilingual language comprehension in the light of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and event-related brain potential (ERP) data. Next, we consider to what extent neuroimaging data are compatible with assumptions and characteristics of available psycholinguistic models of bilingual word processing, in particular the BIA+ model. We argue that this model provides a theoretical framework that is useful for interpreting both the spatial brain activation patterns observed with fMRI and the temporal brain wave patterns of ERP studies. Finally, we demonstrate that neuroimaging data stimulate the specification of hitherto only globally described components of functional psycholinguistic models. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

However, RDF can Only represent thematic metadata and needs to be extended if we want to model spatial and temporal information. For this purpose, we develop the data model stRDF and the query language stSPARQL. stRDF is a constraint data model that extends RDF with the ability to represent spatial and temporal data. stSPARQL extends SPARQL for querying stRDF data. In our extension to RDF, we follow the main ideas of constraint databases and represent spatial and temporal objects as quantifier-free formulas in a first-order logic of linear constraints. Thus an important contribution of stRDF is to bring to the RDF world the benefits of constraint databases and constraint-based reasoning so that spatial and temporal data can be represented in IMP using constraints.

J	Becker, J; Beverungen, DF; Knackstedt, R				Becker, Joerg; Beverungen, Daniel F.; Knackstedt, Ralf			The challenge of conceptual modeling for product-service systems: status-quo and perspectives for reference models and modeling languages	INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND E-BUSINESS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Value bundle; Product-service system; Conceptual modeling; Reference model; Modeling language	DESIGN	Confronted with decreasing margins and a rising customer demand for integrated solutions, manufacturing companies integrate complementary services into their portfolio. Offering value bundles (consisting of services and physical goods) takes place in integrated product-service systems, spanning the coordinated design and delivery of services and physical goods for customers. Conceptual Modeling is an established approach to support and guide such efforts. Using a framework for the design and delivery of value bundles as an analytical lens, this study evaluates the current support of reference models and modeling languages for setting up conceptual models for an integrated design and delivery of value bundles. Consecutively, designing modeling languages and reference models to fit the requirements of conceptual models in product-service systems are presented as upcoming challenges in Service Research. To guide further research, first steps are proposed by exemplarily integrating reference models and modeling languages stemming from the service and manufacturing domains.

It is an open-source project, designed as an Eclipse component, and based on the existing EMF-based realization of the UML2 meta-model. The goal of this open-source project is twofold. First, it is a complete, efficient, robust, and methodologically agnostic implementation of a UML2 tool to both industry and academia. Second, it is an open and flexible facility for defining and utilizing domain-specific modeling languages using a very advanced implementation of the UML profile concept.

J	Brysbaert, M; Duyck, W				Brysbaert, Marc; Duyck, Wouter			Is it time to leave behind the Revised Hierarchical Model of bilingual language processing after fifteen years of service?	BILINGUALISM-LANGUAGE AND COGNITION			English	Article							VISUAL WORD RECOGNITION; NATIVE-LANGUAGE; TRANSLATION; 2ND-LANGUAGE; ACTIVATION; INTERFERENCE; ENGLISH; CONTEXT; NUMBER; BRAIN	The Revised Hierarchical Model (RHM) of bilingual language processing dominates current thinking on bilingual language processing. Recently, basic tenets of the model have been called into question. First, there is little evidence for separate lexicons. Second, there is little evidence for language selective access. Third, the inclusion of excitatory connections between translation equivalents at the lexical level is likely to impede word recognition. Fourth, the connections between L2 words and their meanings are stronger than proposed in RHM. And finally there is good evidence to make a distinction between language-dependent and language-independent semantic features. It is argued that the Revised Hierarchical Model cannot easily be adapted to incorporate these challenges and that a more fruitful way forward is to start from existing computational models of monolingual language processing and see how they can be adapted for bilingual input and output, as has been done in the Bilingual Interactive Activation model.

J	Bendraou, R; Jezequel, JM; Gervais, MP; Blanc, X				Bendraou, Reda; Jezequel, Jean-Marc; Gervais, Marie-Pierre; Blanc, Xavier			A Comparison of Six UML-Based Languages for Software Process Modeling	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Metamodeling; process modeling and execution; software process modeling languages; UML		Describing and managing activities, resources, and constraints of software development processes is a challenging goal for many organizations. A first generation of Software Process Modeling Languages (SPMLs) appeared in the 1990s but failed to gain broad industrial support. Recently, however, a second generation of SPMLs has appeared, leveraging the strong industrial interest for modeling languages such as UML. In this paper, we propose a comparison of these UML-based SPMLs. While not exhaustive, this comparison concentrates on SPMLs most representative of the various alternative approaches, ranging from UML-based framework specializations to full-blown executable metamodeling approaches. To support the comparison of these various approaches, we propose a frame gathering a set of requirements for process modeling, such as semantic richness, modularity, executability, conformity to the UML standard, and formality. Beyond discussing the relative merits of these approaches, we also evaluate the overall suitability of these UML-based SPMLs for software process modeling. Finally, we discuss the impact of these approaches on the current state of the practice, and conclude with lessons we have learned in doing this comparison.

During the procedure, electrical stimulation is used to induce temporary functional lesions and locate 'essential' language areas for preservation. Under stimulation, patients are shown slides of common objects and asked to name them. Cortical stimulation can lead to a variety of naming errors. In the present study, we aggregate errors across patients to examine the neuroanatomical correlates and linguistic characteristics of six common errors: semantic paraphasias, circumlocutions, phonological paraphasias, neologisms, performance errors, and no-response errors. Aiding analysis, we relied on a suite of web-based querying and imaging tools that enabled the summative mapping of normalized stimulation sites. Errors were visualized and analyzed by type and location. We provide descriptive statistics to characterize the commonality of errors across patients and location. The errors observed suggest a widely distributed and heterogeneous cortical network that gives rise to differential patterning of paraphasic errors. Data are discussed in relation to emerging models of language representation that honor distinctions between frontal, parietal, and posterior temporal dorsal implementation systems and ventral-temporal lexical semantic and phonological storage and assembly regions; the latter of which may participate both in language comprehension and production.

Modeling and optimization with Optimica and JModelica.org-Languages and tools for solving large-scale dynamic optimization problems	COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Modelica; Optimica; Dynamic optimization; Model predictive control	IMPLEMENTATION; REDUCTION; JASTADD	The Modelica language, targeted at modeling of complex physical systems, has gained increased attention during the last decade. Modelica is about to establish itself as a de facto standard in the modeling community with strong support both within academia and industry. While there are several tools, both commercial and free, supporting simulation of Modelica models few efforts have been made in the area of dynamic optimization of Modelica models. In this paper, an extension to the Modelica language, entitled Optimica, is reported. Optimica enables compact and intuitive formulations of optimization problems, static and dynamic, based on Modelica models. The paper also reports a novel Modelica-based open source project, JModelica.org, specifically targeted at dynamic optimization. JModelica.org supports the Optimica extension and offers an open platform based on established technologies, including Python, C, Java and XML. Examples are provided to demonstrate the capabilities of Optimica and JModelica.org. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

While neuronal simulators such as NEURON, GENESIS, MOOSE, NEST, and PSICS facilitate the development of these data-driven neuronal models, the specialized languages they employ are generally not interoperable, limiting model accessibility and preventing reuse of model components and cross-simulator validation. To overcome these problems we have used an Open Source software approach to develop NeuroML, a neuronal model description language based on XML (Extensible Markup Language). This enables these detailed models and their components to be defined in a standalone form, allowing them to be used across multiple simulators and archived in a standardized format. Here we describe the structure of NeuroML and demonstrate its scope by converting into NeuroML models of a number of different voltage-and ligand-gated conductances, models of electrical coupling, synaptic transmission and short-term plasticity, together with morphologically detailed models of individual neurons. We have also used these NeuroML-based components to develop an highly detailed cortical network model. NeuroML-based model descriptions were validated by demonstrating similar model behavior across five independently developed simulators. Although our results confirm that simulations run on different simulators converge, they reveal limits to model interoperability, by showing that for some models convergence only occurs at high levels of spatial and temporal discretisation, when the computational overhead is high.

Such analysis can allow modelers to assess the satisfaction of goals, facilitate evaluation of high-level design alternatives, help analysts decide on the high-level requirements and design of the system, test the sanity of a model, and support communication and learning. The analysis of goal models can be done in very different ways depending on the nature of the model and the purpose of the analysis. In our work, we use the Goal-oriented Requirement Language (GRL), which is part of the User Requirements Notation (URN). URN, a new Recommendation of the International Telecommunications Union, provides the first standard goal-oriented language. Using GRL, we develop an approach to analysis that can be done by evaluating qualitative or quantitative satisfaction levels of the actors and intentional elements (e.g., goals and tasks) composing the model. Initial satisfaction levels for some of the intentional elements are provided in a strategy and then propagated to the other intentional elements of the model through the various links that connect them. The results allow for an assessment of the relative effectiveness of design alternatives at the requirements level. Although no specific propagation algorithm is imposed in the URN standard, different criteria for defining evaluation mechanisms are described. We provide three algorithms (quantitative, qualitative, and hybrid) as examples, which satisfy the constraints imposed by the standard. These algorithms have been implemented in the open-source jUCMNav tool, an Eclipse-based editor for URN models. The algorithms are presented and compared with the help of a telecommunication system example. (c) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Agent based models of language competition: macroscopic descriptions and order-disorder transitions	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT			English	Article						critical phenomena of socio-economic systems; interacting agent models; stochastic processes	DYNAMICS; BILINGUALISM; EMERGENCE	We investigate the dynamics of two agent based models of language competition. In the first model, each individual can be in one of two possible states, either using language X or language Y, while the second model incorporates a third state XY, representing individuals that use both languages (bilinguals). We analyze the models on complex networks and two-dimensional square lattices by analytical and numerical methods, and show that they exhibit a transition from one-language dominance to language coexistence. We find that the coexistence of languages is more difficult to maintain in the bilinguals model, where the presence of bilinguals facilitates the ultimate dominance of one of the two languages. A stability analysis reveals that the coexistence is more unlikely to happen in poorly connected than in fully connected networks, and that the dominance of just one language is enhanced as the connectivity decreases. This dominance effect is even stronger in a two-dimensional space, where domain coarsening tends to drive the system towards language consensus.

Enterprises build information systems to support their business processes. Software engineering research has typically focused on the development process, starting with user requirements-if that-with business modeling often confused with software system modeling [Isoda 2001]. Researchers and practitioners in management information systems have long recognized that understanding the business processes that an information system must support is key to eliciting the needs of its users (see e. g., Eriksson and Penker 2000]), but lacked the tools to model such business processes or to relate such models to software requirements. Researchers and practitioners in business administration have long been interested in modeling the processes of organizations for the purposes of understanding, analyzing, and improving such processes [Hammer and Champy 1993], but their models were often too coarse to be of use to software engineers. The advent of ecommerce and workflow management systems, among other things, has led to a convergence of interests and tools, within the broad IT community, for modeling and enabling business processes. In this article we present an overview of business process modeling languages. We first propose a categorization of the various languages and then describe representative languages from each family.

Both approaches rely on the existence of a handcrafted generator, which limits their scalability to new domains. This paper presents BAGEL, a statistical language generator which uses dynamic Bayesian networks to learn from semantically-aligned data produced by 42 untrained annotators. A human evaluation shows that BAGEL can generate natural and informative utterances from unseen inputs in the information presentation domain. Additionally, generation performance on sparse datasets is improved significantly by using certainty-based active learning, yielding ratings close to the human gold standard with a fraction of the data.

J	zur Muehlen, M; Indulska, M				zur Muehlen, Michael; Indulska, Marta			Modeling languages for business processes and business rules: A representational analysis	INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd International Workshop on Vocabularies, Ontologies and Rules in the Enterprise/11th IEEE International EDOC Conference	OCT, 2007	Annapolis, MD			Business process modeling; Business rule modeling; Business process management; Representation theory; BWW; BPMN; SBVR; PRR; SRML; SWRL	SYSTEMS	Process modeling and rule modeling languages are both used to document organizational policies and procedures. To date, their synergies and overlap are under-researched. Understanding the relationship between the two modeling types would allow organizations to maximize synergies, avoid content duplication, and thus reduce their overall modeling effort. In this paper, we use the Bunge-Wand-Weber (BWW) representation theory to compare the representation capabilities of process and rule modeling languages. We perform a representational analysis of four rule modeling specifications: The Simple Rule Markup Language (SRML), the Semantic Web Rules Language (SWRL), the Production Rule Representation (PRR), and the Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules (SBVR) specification. We compare their BWW representation capabilities with those of four popular conceptual process modeling languages. In our analysis, we focus on the aspects of maximum ontological completeness and minimum ontological overlap. The outcome of this study shows that no single language is internally complete with respect to the BWW representation model. We also show that a combination of two languages, in particular SRML and BPMN, appears to be better suited for combined process and rule modeling than any of these modeling languages used independently.

J	Strange, W				Strange, Winifred			Automatic selective perception (ASP) of first and second language speech: A working model	JOURNAL OF PHONETICS			English	Article							AMERICAN ENGLISH VOWELS; PASS NOISE MASKING; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SOUNDS VERTICAL-BAR; CONSONANTAL CONTEXT; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; NORTH GERMAN; LANGUAGE; JAPANESE; FRENCH	In this model, speech perception is characterized as a purposeful, information-seeking activity whereby adult listeners detect the most reliable acoustic parameters that specify phonetic segments and sequences in their native language (L1), using highly over-learned selective perception routines. In laboratory perceptual tasks, differentiation of L1 phonetic contrasts is rapid and robust even in suboptimal listening conditions and even when the listeners focus on other levels of language structure, or indeed on another task. In contrast, late second language (L2) learners must employ greater attentional resources in order to extract sufficient information to differentiate phonetic contrasts that do not occur in their native language. Phonetic and phonological modes of speech perception are described, which can be tapped in the laboratory by manipulations of stimulus complexity and task demands. These experimental manipulations reveal complex interactions between the linguistic experience of listeners and phonetic similarity relationships between L1 and L2 phonological inventories. Illustrative experimental evidence from my studies of vowel perception using perceptual assimilation (cross-language identification), speeded discrimination, discrimination in speech babble, and brain indices of discrimination (MMN) are presented to provide operational definitions of these concepts. Similarities and differences from other current theories of cross-language and L2 speech perception are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Contemporary neuroscience indicates that anterior temporal regions and the ""ventral"" language pathway also make a significant contribution, yet there is no computationally-implemented model of the dual pathway, nor any synthesis of normal and aphasic behavior. The ""Lichtheim 2"" model was implemented by developing a new variety of computational model which reproduces and explains normal and patient data but also incorporates neuroanatomical information into its architecture. By bridging the ""mind-brain"" gap in this way, the resultant ""neurocomputational"" model provides a unique opportunity to explore the relationship between lesion location and behavioral deficits, and to provide a platform for simulating functional neuroimaging data."

J	Charlton, SR; Parkhurst, DL				Charlton, Scott R.; Parkhurst, David L.			Modules based on the geochemical model PHREEQC for use in scripting and programming languages	COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES			English	Article						Geochemical modeling; PHREEQC; Reactive-transport modeling; COM; Component object model; C plus; C; Fortran	REACTIVE TRANSPORT; FLOW; SYSTEMS; SOIL; TOOL	The geochemical model PHREEQC is capable of simulating a wide range of equilibrium reactions between water and minerals, ion exchangers, surface complexes, solid solutions, and gases. It also has a general kinetic formulation that allows modeling of nonequilibrium mineral dissolution and precipitation, microbial reactions, decomposition of organic compounds, and other kinetic reactions. To facilitate use of these reaction capabilities in scripting languages and other models. PHREEQC has been implemented in modules that easily interface with other software. A Microsoft COM (component object model) has been implemented, which allows PHREEQC to be used by any software that can interface with a COM server-for example, Excel (R), Visual Basic (R), Python, or MATLAB (R), PHREEQC has been converted to a C++ class, which can be included in programs written in C++. The class also has been compiled in libraries for Linux and Windows that allow PHREEQC to be called from C++, C, and Fortran. A limited set of methods implements the full reaction capabilities of PHREEQC for each module. Input methods use strings or files to define reaction calculations in exactly the same formats used by PHREEQC. Output methods provide a table of user-selected model results, such as concentrations, activities, saturation indices, and densities. The PHREEQC module can add geochemical reaction capabilities to surface-water, groundwater, and watershed transport models. It is possible to store and manipulate solution compositions and reaction information for many cells within the module. In addition, the object-oriented nature of the PHREEQC modules simplifies implementation of parallel processing for reactive-transport models. The PHREEQC COM module may be used in scripting languages to fit parameters; to plot PHREEQC results for field, laboratory, or theoretical investigations; or to develop new models that include simple or complex geochemical calculations.

For both groups, a five-factor model provided the best fit to the data. Four of the factors represented aspects of written composition: macro-organization (use of top sentence and number and ordering of ideas), productivity (number and diversity of words used), complexity (mean length of T-unit and syntactic density), and spelling and punctuation. The fifth factor represented handwriting fluency. Handwriting fluency was correlated with written composition factors at both grades. The magnitude of developmental differences between first grade and fourth grade expressed as effect sizes varied for variables representing the five constructs: large effect sizes were found for productivity and handwriting fluency variables; moderate effect sizes were found for complexity and macro-organization variables; and minimal effect sizes were found for spelling and punctuation variables.

However, the absence of a user-friendly modeling framework that provides access to a wide range of modeling capabilities is hampering the wider adoption of computational methods by non-experts. RosettaScripts is an XML-like language for specifying modeling tasks in the Rosetta framework. RosettaScripts provides access to protocol-level functionalities, such as rigid-body docking and sequence redesign, and allows fast testing and deployment of complex protocols without need for modifying or recompiling the underlying C++ code. We illustrate these capabilities with RosettaScripts protocols for the stabilization of proteins, the generation of computationally constrained libraries for experimental selection of higher-affinity binding proteins, loop remodeling, small-molecule ligand docking, design of ligand-binding proteins, and specificity redesign in DNA-binding proteins.

J	Steels, L				Steels, Luc			Modeling the cultural evolution of language	PHYSICS OF LIFE REVIEWS			English	Review						Language evolution; Cultural evolution; Evolutionary linguistics; Biolinguistics; Semiotic dynamics	EMERGENCE; GRAMMAR; SPEECH; GENES; PROTOLANGUAGE; POPULATION; FRAMEWORK; SYSTEM; FOXP2	The paper surveys recent research on language evolution, focusing in particular on models of cultural evolution and how they are being developed and tested using agent-based computational simulations and robotic experiments. The key challenges for evolutionary theories of language are outlined and some example results are discussed, highlighting models explaining how linguistic conventions get shared, how conceptual frameworks get coordinated through language, and how hierarchical structure could emerge. The main conclusion of the paper is that cultural evolution is a much more powerful process that usually assumed, implying that less innate structures or biases are required and consequently that human language evolution has to rely less on genetic evolution.

While this model has been shown to significantly outperform many competitive language modeling techniques in terms of accuracy, the remaining problem is the computational complexity. In this work, we show approaches that lead to more than 15 times speedup for both training and testing phases. Next, we show importance of using a backpropagation through time algorithm. An empirical comparison with feedforward networks is also provided. In the end, we discuss possibilities how to reduce the amount of parameters in the model. The resulting RNN model can thus be smaller, faster both during training and testing, and more accurate than the basic one.

J	Atkinson, QD				Atkinson, Quentin D.			Phonemic Diversity Supports a Serial Founder Effect Model of Language Expansion from Africa	SCIENCE			English	Article							CULTURAL-EVOLUTION; POPULATION-SIZE; SOUTH-AFRICA; DISTANCE; PHYLOGENY; CLIMATE; HUMANS	Human genetic and phenotypic diversity declines with distance from Africa, as predicted by a serial founder effect in which successive population bottlenecks during range expansion progressively reduce diversity, underpinning support for an African origin of modern humans. Recent work suggests that a similar founder effect may operate on human culture and language. Here I show that the number of phonemes used in a global sample of 504 languages is also clinal and fits a serial founder-effect model of expansion from an inferred origin in Africa. This result, which is not explained by more recent demographic history, local language diversity, or statistical non-independence within language families, points to parallel mechanisms shaping genetic and linguistic diversity and supports an African origin of modern human languages.

Even though these tools facilitate the automation of software engineering tasks and activities, such tools are typically engineered manually. However, many of these tools have a common semantic foundation centered around an underlying modeling language, which would make it possible to automate their development if the modeling language specification were formalized. Even though there has been much work in formalizing programming languages, with many successful tools constructed using such formalisms, there has been little work in formalizing modeling languages for the purpose of automation. This paper discusses possible semantics-based approaches for the formalization of modeling languages and describes how this formalism may be used to automate the construction of modeling tools.

The primary reason is that conventional modeling languages (e.g., Petri nets, BPMN, EPCs, and ULM ADs) have difficulties representing the observed behavior properly and/or succinctly. Moreover, discovered process models tend to have deadlocks and live-locks. Therefore, we advocate a new representation more suitable for process discovery: causal nets. Causal nets are related to the representations used by several process discovery techniques (e.g., heuristic mining, fuzzy mining, and genetic mining). However, unlike existing approaches, we provide declarative semantics more suitable for process mining. To clarify these semantics and to illustrate the non-local nature of this new representation, we relate causal nets to Petri nets.

Method: This tutorial introduces SLPs to basic concepts and terminology related to IRT as well as the most common IRT models. The article then continues with an overview of how instruments are developed using IRT and some basic principles of adaptive testing. Conclusion: IRT is a set of statistical methods that are increasingly used for developing instruments in speech-language pathology. While IRT is not new, its application in speech-language pathology to date has been relatively limited in scope. Several new IRT-based instruments are currently emerging. IRT differs from traditional methods for test development, typically referred to as classical test theory (CTT), in several theoretical and practical ways. Administration, scoring, and interpretation of IRT instruments are different from methods used for most traditional CTT instruments. SLPs will need to understand the basic concepts of IRT instruments to use these tools in their clinical and research work.

Reciprocal effects were tested with dyads of mothers and their children participating in the National Institute of Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development. Sensitive maternal interactions positively affected children's later expressive language in the second and third years of life. Although maternal sensitivity predicted later language skills in children, children's language did not affect later maternal sensitivity as indicated in a structural equation model. These results do not support the 1975 transactional model of child development of Sameroff and Chandler. A consistent pattern of sensitivity throughout infancy and early childhood indicates the importance of fostering maternal sensitivity in infancy for prevention or remediation of expressive language problems in young children.

However, cultures that lack a conventional counting system typically differ from cultures that have such systems, not only in language but also in many other ways. As a result, it is difficult to isolate the effects of language on the development of number representations. Here we examine the numerical abilities of individuals who lack conventional language for number (deaf individuals who do not have access to a usable model for language, spoken or signed) but who live in a numerate culture (Nicaragua) and thus have access to other aspects of culture that might foster the development of number. These deaf individuals develop their own gestures, called homesigns, to communicate. We show that home-signers use gestures to communicate about number. However, they do not consistently extend the correct number of fingers when communicating about sets greater than three, nor do they always correctly match the number of items in one set to a target set when that target set is greater than three. Thus, even when integrated into a numerate society, individuals who lack input from a conventional language do not spontaneously develop representations of large exact numerosities.

On the baseline setup using the original language models we decrease word error rate (WER) more than 1% absolute by n-best list rescoring and language model adaptation. When n-gram language models are trained on the same moderately sized data set as the RNN models, improvements are higher yielding a system which performs comparable to the baseline. A noticeable improvement was observed with unsupervised adaptation of RNN models. Furthermore, we examine the influence of word history on WER and show how to speed-up rescoring by caching common prefix strings.

Dynamic Causal Modeling of Subcortical Connectivity of Language	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							STRUCTURAL CONNECTIVITY; SPEECH COMPREHENSION; THALAMIC INFARCTION; EVOKED-RESPONSES; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; NEURAL BASIS; BRAIN; MEG; LOCALIZATION; EEG	Subcortical-cortical interactions in the language network were investigated using dynamic causal modeling of magnetoencephalographic data recorded during auditory comprehension. Participants heard sentences that either were correct or contained violations. Sentences containing violations had syntactic or prosodic violations or both. We show that a hidden source, modeling magnetically silent deep nuclei, is required to explain the data best. This is in line with recent brain imaging studies and intracranial recordings suggesting an involvement of subcortical structures in language processing. Here, the processing of syntactic and prosodic violations elicited a global increase in the amplitude of evoked responses, both at the cortical and subcortical levels. As estimated by Bayesian model averaging, this was accompanied by various changes in cortical-cortical and subcortical-cortical connectivity. The most consistent findings in relation to violations were a decrease of reentrant inputs to Heschl's gyrus (HG) and of transcallosal lateral connections. These results suggest that in conditions where one hemisphere detects a violation, possibly via fast thalamocortical (HG) loops, the intercallosal connectivity is reduced to allow independent processing of syntax (left hemisphere) and of prosody (right hemisphere). This study is the first demonstration in cognitive neuroscience that subcortical-cortical loops can be empirically investigated using noninvasive electrophysiological recordings.

Here, we review neurobiological and genetic influences on spoken language development in the context of results of a longitudinal trial of cochlear implantation of young children with severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss in the Childhood Development after Cochlear Implantation study. We specifically examine the results of cochlear implantation in participants who were congenitally deaf (N=116). Prior to intervention, these participants were subject to naturally imposed constraints in sensory (acoustic-phonologic) inputs during critical phases of development when spoken language skills are typically achieved rapidly. Their candidacy for a cochlear implant was prompted by delays (n=20) or an essential absence of spoken language acquisition (n=96). Observations thus present an opportunity to evaluate the impact of factors that influence the emergence of spoken language, particularly in the context of hearing restoration in sensitive periods for language acquisition. Outcomes demonstrate considerable variation in spoken language learning, although significant advantages exist for the congenitally deaf children implanted prior to 18 months of age. While age at implantation carries high predictive value in forecasting performance on measures of spoken language, several factors show significant association, particularly those related to parent-child interactions. Importantly, the significance of environmental variables in their predictive value for language development varies with age at implantation. These observations are considered in the context of an epigenetic model in which dynamic genomic expression can modulate aspects of auditory learning, offering insights into factors that can influence a child's acquisition of spoken language after cochlear implantation. Increased understanding of these interactions could lead to targeted interventions that interact with the epigenome to influence language outcomes with intervention, particularly in periods in which development is subject to time-sensitive experience.

J	Chien, JT; Chueh, CH				Chien, Jen-Tzung; Chueh, Chuang-Hua			Dirichlet Class Language Models for Speech Recognition	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING			English	Article						Bayes procedure; clustering method; natural language; smoothing method; speech recognition		Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) was successfully developed for document modeling due to its generalization to unseen documents through the latent topic modeling. LDA calculates the probability of a document based on the bag-of-words scheme without considering the order of words. Accordingly, LDA cannot be directly adopted to predict words in speech recognition systems. This work presents a new Dirichlet class language model (DCLM), which projects the sequence of history words onto a latent class space and calculates a marginal likelihood over the uncertainties of classes, which are expressed by Dirichlet priors. A Bayesian class-based language model is established and a variational Bayesian procedure is presented for estimating DCLM parameters. Furthermore, the long-distance class information is continuously updated using the large-span history words and is dynamically incorporated into class mixtures for a cache DCLM. Different language models are experimentally evaluated using the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus. The amount of training data and the size of vocabulary are evaluated. We find that the cache DCLM effectively characterizes the unseen n-gram events and stores the class information for long-distance language modeling. This approach out-performs the other class-based and topic-based language models in terms of perplexity and recognition accuracy. The DCLM and cache DCLM achieved relative gain of word error rate by 3% to 5% over the LDA topic-based language model with different sizes of training data.

Seventy Greek children were followed from kindergarten until grade 4. In kindergarten they were tested in non-verbal intelligence, vocabulary, phonological sensitivity, rapid naming, and letter knowledge. The parents of the children also responded on a questionnaire regarding the frequency of storybook reading, the number of books at home, and the frequency of teaching letter names, sounds, and words. Reading fluency and comprehension were measured in grade 4. The results indicated that the early home literacy experience variables were related to the emergent literacy skills but did not directly predict future reading skills. Thus, the Home Literacy Model applies to consistent orthographies before any formal reading instruction takes place. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We show results obtained after combining all these models by using linear interpolation. We conclude that for both small and moderately sized tasks, we obtain new state of the art results with combination of models, that is significantly better than performance of any individual model. Obtained perplexity reductions against Good-Turing trigram baseline are over 50% and against modified Kneser-Ney smoothed 5-gram over 40%.

In this paper, we improve their performance by providing a contextual real-valued input vector in association with each word. This vector is used to convey contextual information about the sentence being modeled. By performing Latent Dirichlet Allocation using a block of preceding text, we achieve a topic-conditioned RNNLM. This approach has the key advantage of avoiding the data fragmentation associated with building multiple topic models on different data subsets. We report perplexity results on the Penn Treebank data, where we achieve a new state-of-the-art.

In the last decade, the formalism of L-systems has emerged as a major paradigm for modeling plant development. Previous implementations of this formalism were made based on static languages, i.e., languages that require explicit definition of variable types before using them. These languages are often efficient but involve quite a lot of syntactic overhead, thus restricting the flexibility of use for modelers. In this work, we present an adaptation of L-systems to the Python language, a popular and powerful open-license dynamic language. We show that the use of dynamic language properties makes it possible to enhance the development of plant growth models: (i) by keeping a simple syntax while allowing for high-level programming constructs, (ii) by making code execution easy and avoiding compilation overhead, (iii) by allowing a high-level of model reusability and the building of complex modular models, and (iv) by providing powerful solutions to integrate MTG data-structures (that are a common way to represent plants at several scales) into L-systems and thus enabling to use a wide spectrum of computer tools based on MTGs developed for plant architecture. We then illustrate the use of L-Py in real applications to build complex models or to teach plant modeling in the classroom.

San			MODELING TWO-LANGUAGE COMPETITION DYNAMICS	ADVANCES IN COMPLEX SYSTEMS			English	Article						Language competition; bilingualism; opinion dynamics	LANGUAGE; BILINGUALISM; RESILIENCE; VIABILITY	During the last decade, much attention has been paid to language competition in the complex systems community, that is, how the fractions of speakers of several competing languages evolve in time. In this paper, we review recent advances in this direction and focus on three aspects. First, we consider the shift from two-state models to three-state models that include the possibility of bilingual individuals. The understanding of the role played by bilingualism is essential in sociolinguistics. In particular, the question addressed is whether bilingualism facilitates the coexistence of languages. Second, we will analyze the effect of social interaction networks and physical barriers. Finally, we will show how to analyze the issue of bilingualism from a game theoretical perspective.

J	Cunnings, I				Cunnings, Ian			An overview of mixed-effects statistical models for second language researchers	SECOND LANGUAGE RESEARCH			English	Review						statistics; mixed-effects models; fixed effect; random effects; second language acquisition	RESEARCH METHODOLOGY; LANGUAGE	As in any field of scientific inquiry, advancements in the field of second language acquisition (SLA) rely in part on the interpretation and generalizability of study findings using quantitative data analysis and inferential statistics. While statistical techniques such as ANOVA and t-tests are widely used in second language research, this review article provides a review of a class of newer statistical models that have not yet been widely adopted in the field, but have garnered interest in other fields of language research. The class of statistical models called mixed-effects models are introduced, and the potential benefits of these models for the second language researcher are discussed. A simple example of mixed-effects data analysis using the statistical software package R (R Development Core Team, 2011) is provided as an introduction to the use of these statistical techniques, and to exemplify how such analyses can be reported in research articles. It is concluded that mixed-effects models provide the second language researcher with a powerful tool for the analysis of a variety of types of second language acquisition data.

J	Gow, DW				Gow, David W., Jr.			The cortical organization of lexical knowledge: A dual lexicon model of spoken language processing	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE			English	Review						Lexicon; Language; Spoken word recognition; Lexical access; Speech perception; Speech production; Neuroimaging; Aphasia; Dual stream model; Localization	EVENT-RELATED FMRI; TRANSCORTICAL SENSORY APHASIA; ANTERIOR TEMPORAL CORTEX; VOICE-ONSET TIME; SENTENCE COMPREHENSION; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; COMPUTATIONAL PRINCIPLES; NEIGHBORHOOD ACTIVATION; FUNCTIONAL NEUROANATOMY; CONDUCTION APHASIA	Current accounts of spoken language assume the existence of a lexicon where wordforms are stored and interact during spoken language perception, understanding and production. Despite the theoretical importance of the wordform lexicon, the exact localization and function of the lexicon in the broader context of language use is not well understood. This review draws on evidence from aphasia, functional imaging, neuroanatomy, laboratory phonology and behavioral results to argue for the existence of parallel lexica that facilitate different processes in the dorsal and ventral speech pathways. The dorsal lexicon, localized in the inferior parietal region including the supramarginal gyrus, serves as an interface between phonetic and articulatory representations. The ventral lexicon, localized in the posterior superior temporal sulcus and middle temporal gyrus, serves as an interface between phonetic and semantic representations. In addition to their interface roles, the two lexica contribute to the robustness of speech processing. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Whereas feed-forward networks only exploit a fixed context length to predict the next word of a sequence, conceptually, standard recurrent neural networks can take into account all of the predecessor words. On the other hand, it is well known that recurrent networks are difficult to train and therefore are unlikely to show the full potential of recurrent models. These problems are addressed by a the Long Short-Term Memory neural network architecture. In this work, we analyze this type of network on an English and a large French language modeling task. Experiments show improvements of about 8 % relative in perplexity over standard recurrent neural network LMs. In addition, we gain considerable improvements in WER on top of a state-of-the-art speech recognition system.

J	Rice, ML				Rice, Mabel L.			Toward epigenetic and gene regulation models of specific language impairment: looking for links among growth, genes, and impairments	JOURNAL OF NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS			English	Review							MEAN LENGTH; CHILDREN; SPEECH; ACQUISITION; TENSE; PREVALENCE; SLI; ASSOCIATION; VOCABULARY; STABILITY	Children with specific language impairment (SLI) are thought to have an inherited form of language impairment that spares other developmental domains. SLI shows strong heritability and recent linkage and association studies have replicated results for candidate genes. Regulatory regions of the genes may be involved. Behavioral growth models of language development of children with SLI reveal that the onset of language is delayed, and the growth trajectories of children with SLI parallel those of younger children without SLI. The rate of language acquisition decelerates in the pre-adolescent period, resulting in immature language levels for the children with SLI that persist into adolescence and beyond. Recent genetic and epigenetic discoveries and models relevant to language impairment are reviewed. T cell regulation of onset, acceleration, and deceleration signaling are described as potential conceptual parallels to the growth timing elements of language acquisition and impairment. A growth signaling disruption (GSD) hypothesis is proposed for SLI, which posits that faulty timing mechanisms at the cellular level, intrinsic to neurocortical functioning essential for language onset and growth regulation, are at the core of the growth outcomes of SLI. The GSD highlights the need to document and account for growth patterns over childhood and suggests needed directions for future investigation.

Process model-based atomic service discovery and composition of composite semantic web services using web ontology language for services (OWL-S)	ENTERPRISE INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						composite semantic web services (CSWS); matchmaking; process model; service discovery; service composition; business-to-business (B2B)		Web Service composition has become indispensable as a single web service cannot satisfy complex functional requirements. Composition of services has received much interest to support business-to-business (B2B) or enterprise application integration. An important component of the service composition is the discovery of relevant services. In Semantic Web Services (SWS), service discovery is generally achieved by using service profile of Ontology Web Languages for Services (OWL-S). The profile of the service is a derived and concise description but not a functional part of the service. The information contained in the service profile is sufficient for atomic service discovery, but it is not sufficient for the discovery of composite semantic web services (CSWS). The purpose of this article is two-fold: first to prove that the process model is a better choice than the service profile for service discovery. Second, to facilitate the composition of inter-organisational CSWS by proposing a new composition method which uses process ontology. The proposed service composition approach uses an algorithm which performs a fine grained match at the level of atomic process rather than at the level of the entire service in a composite semantic web service. Many works carried out in this area have proposed solutions only for the composition of atomic services and this article proposes a solution for the composition of composite semantic web services.

Bootstrapping in a language of thought: A formal model of numerical concept learning	COGNITION			English	Article						Number word learning; Bootstrapping; Cognitive development; Bayesian model; Language of thought; CP transition	NUMBER WORDS; CHILDREN; ACQUISITION; INTEGERS	In acquiring number words, children exhibit a qualitative leap in which they transition from understanding a few number words, to possessing a rich system of interrelated numerical concepts. We present a computational framework for understanding this inductive leap as the consequence of statistical inference over a sufficiently powerful representational system. We provide an implemented model that is powerful enough to learn number word meanings and other related conceptual systems from naturalistic data. The model shows that bootstrapping can be made computationally and philosophically well-founded as a theory of number learning. Our approach demonstrates how learners may combine core cognitive operations to build sophisticated representations during the course of development, and how this process explains observed developmental patterns in number word learning.

J	Rasanen, O				Rasanen, Okko			Computational modeling of phonetic and lexical learning in early language acquisition: Existing models and future directions	SPEECH COMMUNICATION			English	Article						Language acquisition; Distributional learning; Computer simulation; Phonetic learning; Lexical learning	SPEECH-PERCEPTION; WORD SEGMENTATION; INFANTS; CUES; RECOGNITION; CATEGORIES; SOUND; INFORMATION; FEEDBACK; PRINCIPLES	This work reviews a number of existing computational studies concentrated on the question of how spoken language can be learned from continuous speech in the absence of linguistically or phonetically motivated background knowledge, a situation faced by human infants when they first attempt to learn their native language. Specifically, the focus is on how phonetic categories and word-like units can be acquired purely on the basis of the statistical structure of speech signals, possibly aided by some articulatory or visual constraints. The outcomes and shortcomings of the existing work are reflected onto findings from experimental and theoretical studies. Finally, some of the open questions and possible future research directions related to the computational models of language acquisition are discussed. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Model checking agent programming languages	AUTOMATED SOFTWARE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Multi-agent systems; Agent programming languages; BDI formal verification; Model checking; Java PathFinder	ALLOCATION	In this paper we describe a verification system for multi-agent programs. This is the first comprehensive approach to the verification of programs developed using programming languages based on the BDI (belief-desire-intention) model of agency. In particular, we have developed a specific layer of abstraction, sitting between the underlying verification system and the agent programming language, that maps the semantics of agent programs into the relevant model-checking framework. Crucially, this abstraction layer is both flexible and extensible; not only can a variety of different agent programming languages be implemented and verified, but even heterogeneous multi-agent programs can be captured semantically. In addition to describing this layer, and the semantic mapping inherent within it, we describe how the underlying model-checker is driven and how agent properties are checked. We also present several examples showing how the system can be used. As this is the first system of its kind, it is relatively slow, so we also indicate further work that needs to be tackled to improve performance.

J	Runnqvist, E; Strijkers, K; Alario, FX; Costa, A				Runnqvist, Elin; Strijkers, Kristof; Alario, F-Xavier; Costa, Albert			Cumulative semantic interference is blind to language: Implications for models of bilingual speech production	JOURNAL OF MEMORY AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						Bilingualism; Language control; Speech production; Semantic competitor effect; Cumulative semantic interference	PICTURE-WORD INTERFERENCE; HIGHLY PROFICIENT BILINGUALS; SPREADING-ACTIVATION THEORY; LEXICAL ACCESS; TIME-COURSE; BRAIN POTENTIALS; ORTHOGRAPHIC FACILITATION; DISTRACTOR FREQUENCY; SENTENCE PRODUCTION; RESPONSE EXCLUSION	Several studies have shown that concepts spread activation to words of both of a bilingual's languages. Therefore, a central issue that needs to be clarified is how a bilingual manages to restrict his speech production to a single language. One influential proposal is that when speaking in one language, the other language is inhibited. An alternative hypothesis is that bilinguals focus only on the language that is relevant for communication. Here these proposals were tested in a series of experiments in which Spanish-Catalan bilinguals named pictures. Cumulative semantic interference (CSI) was used as a window into lexical processing and cross-linguistic interactions. Results revealed that CSI is present between languages with the same magnitude as within-languages. This result cannot be accounted for by any of the above-mentioned models without substantial modifications. Instead, they are suggestive of bilingual processing dynamics qualitatively similar to those of monolinguals. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Based on a peer code review process model, we developed an online assessment system called EduPCR and used a novel approach to assess the learning of computer programming languages. Using this approach, students peer review programs written by other students, share ideas and make suggestions to achieve an objective of collaborative and interactive learning. Teachers assess and give scores to students based on their performance in writing, reviewing and revising programs and their abidance to a peer code review process. After using this approach in two courses in two consecutive semesters, we observed significant improvements of student learning in various aspects. We also conducted two questionnaire surveys and two interviews. The survey data and the interview report indicated that this assessment approach demonstrates high practical values in assessing student learning outcomes in programming languages. Additionally, this approach leads to several interesting research topics for future research in this field. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Imperative versus Declarative Process Modeling Languages: An Empirical Investigation	BUSINESS PROCESS MANAGEMENT WORKSHOPS, PT I	Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing		English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Business Process Management (BPM 2011)	AUG 29, 2011	Clermont Ferrand, FRANCE			Imperative and Declarative Business Process Models; Cognitive Dimensions Framework; Empirical Research		Streams of research are emerging that emphasize the advantages of using declarative process modeling languages over more traditional, imperative approaches. In particular, the declarative modeling approach is known for its ability to cope with the limited flexibility of the imperative approach. However, there is still not much empirical insight into the actual strengths and the applicability of each modeling paradigm. In this paper, we investigate in an experimental setting if either the imperative or the declarative process modeling approach is superior with respect to process model understanding. Even when task types are considered that should better match one or the other, our study finds that imperative process modeling languages appear to be connected with better understanding.

Development of morphological awareness and vocabulary knowledge in Spanish-speaking language minority learners: A parallel process latent growth curve model	APPLIED PSYCHOLINGUISTICS			English	Article							READING-COMPREHENSION; ENGLISH; WORD; LITERACY; CHILDREN; ACQUISITION; ABILITY; SCHOOL	Despite acknowledgement of the limited English vocabularies demonstrated by many language minority (LM) learners, few studies have identified skills that relate to variation in vocabulary growth in this population. This study investigated the concurrent development of morphological awareness (i.e., students' understanding of complex words as combinations of meaningful smaller units) and vocabulary for LM learners in early adolescence. A cohort of Spanish-speaking LM learners (n = 90) was followed from fourth through seventh grade and assessed annually. Latent growth modeling results indicated a strong relationship between rates of growth in the two skills, such that learners with rapid growth in derivational morphological awareness also demonstrated rapid growth in vocabulary. Despite positive vocabulary growth during this period, the learners remained far below national norms. Findings highlight the need for language-focused instructional intervention for this population and suggest that morphological awareness may be a promising point of leverage for such instruction.

Vocabulary knowledge was measured in both breadth (Vocabulary Levels Test) and depth (Word Associates Test); grammatical measures focused on learners' implicit (timed grammaticality judgment task), as well as explicit knowledge (grammatical error correction task); reading comprehension had three indicators, namely, co-reference, textual inference, and gist. Vocabulary knowledge related significantly to reading comprehension; grammatical knowledge showed a weak contribution to reading comprehension after controlling for the effect of vocabulary knowledge. In addition, learners' implicit knowledge of grammar had a stronger relationship to reading comprehension than explicit knowledge, over and above the effect of vocabulary size.

J	Gerlach, M; Altmann, EG				Gerlach, Martin; Altmann, Eduardo G.			Stochastic Model for the Vocabulary Growth in Natural Languages	PHYSICAL REVIEW X			English	Article							POWER-LAWS; WORD-USE; EVOLUTION; DYNAMICS	We propose a stochastic model for the number of different words in a given database which incorporates the dependence on the database size and historical changes. The main feature of our model is the existence of two different classes of words: (i) a finite number of core words, which have higher frequency and do not affect the probability of a new word to be used, and (ii) the remaining virtually infinite number of noncore words, which have lower frequency and, once used, reduce the probability of a new word to be used in the future. Our model relies on a careful analysis of the Google Ngram database of books published in the last centuries, and its main consequence is the generalization of Zipf's and Heaps' law to two-scaling regimes. We confirm that these generalizations yield the best simple description of the data among generic descriptive models and that the two free parameters depend only on the language but not on the database. From the point of view of our model, the main change on historical time scales is the composition of the specific words included in the finite list of core words, which we observe to decay exponentially in time with a rate of approximately 30 words per year for English.

J	Bouchard-Cote, A; Hall, D; Griffiths, TL; Klein, D				Bouchard-Cote, Alexandre; Hall, David; Griffiths, Thomas L.; Klein, Dan			Automated reconstruction of ancient languages using probabilistic models of sound change	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						ancestral; computational; diachronic	MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; EVOLUTIONARY; ALIGNMENT; SEQUENCE; SUPPORT	One of the oldest problems in linguistics is reconstructing the words that appeared in the protolanguages from which modern languages evolved. Identifying the forms of these ancient languages makes it possible to evaluate proposals about the nature of language change and to draw inferences about human history. Protolanguages are typically reconstructed using a painstaking manual process known as the comparative method. We present a family of probabilistic models of sound change as well as algorithms for performing inference in these models. The resulting system automatically and accurately reconstructs protolanguages from modern languages. We apply this system to 637 Austronesian languages, providing an accurate, large-scale automatic reconstruction of a set of protolanguages. Over 85% of the system's reconstructions are within one character of the manual reconstruction provided by a linguist specializing in Austronesian languages. Being able to automatically reconstruct large numbers of languages provides a useful way to quantitatively explore hypotheses about the factors determining which sounds in a language are likely to change over time. We demonstrate this by showing that the reconstructed Austronesian protolanguages provide compelling support for a hypothesis about the relationship between the function of a sound and its probability of changing that was first proposed in 1955.

The proposed query language is intended for selecting, updating and deleting of data stored in Industry Foundation Classes models. Even though some partial solutions already have been suggested, none of them are open source, domain specific, platform independent and implemented at the same time. This paper provides an overview of existing approaches, conceptual sketches of the language in development and documents the current state of implementation as a prototype plugin developed for the open source model server platform bimserver.org. We report on the execution of example test-cases to show the general feasibility of the approach chosen. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

If the computer systems of an enterprise are modeled with CySeMoL, this inference engine can assess the probability that attacks on the systems will succeed. The theory used for the attack-probability calculations in CySeMoL is a compilation of research results on a number of security domains and covers a range of attacks and countermeasures. The theory has previously been validated on a component level. In this paper, the theory is also validated on a system level. A test indicates that the reasonableness and correctness of CySeMoL assessments compare with the reasonableness and correctness of the assessments of a security professional.

FAMILIAR: A domain-specific language for large scale management of feature models	SCIENCE OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMING			English	Article						Domain-specific language; Feature model; Software product lines; Variability; Model management	VARIABILITY	The feature model formalism has become the de facto standard for managing variability in software product lines (SPLs). In practice, developing an SPL can involve modeling a large number of features representing different viewpoints, sub-systems or concerns of the software system. This activity is generally tedious and error-prone. In this article, we present FAMILIAR a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) that is dedicated to the large scale management of feature models and that complements existing tool support. The language provides a powerful support for separating concerns in feature modeling, through the provision of composition and decomposition operators, reasoning facilities and scripting capabilities with modularization mechanisms. We illustrate how an SPL consisting of medical imaging services can be practically managed using reusable FAMILIAR scripts that implement reasoning mechanisms. We also report on various usages and applications of FAMILIAR and its operators, to demonstrate their applicability to different domains and use for different purposes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	Pearl, L; Sprouse, J				Pearl, Lisa; Sprouse, Jon			Syntactic Islands and Learning Biases: Combining Experimental Syntax and Computational Modeling to Investigate the Language Acquisition Problem	LANGUAGE ACQUISITION			English	Article							WORKING-MEMORY CAPACITY; WH-MOVEMENT; INFANTS; DEPENDENCIES; CONSTRAINTS; STIMULUS; GRAMMAR; POVERTY; EXTRACTION; PRINCIPLES	The induction problems facing language learners have played a central role in debates about the types of learning biases that exist in the human brain. Many linguists have argued that some of the learning biases necessary to solve these language induction problems must be both innate and language-specific (i.e., the Universal Grammar (UG) hypothesis). Though there have been several recent high-profile investigations of the necessary learning bias types for different linguistic phenomena, the UG hypothesis is still the dominant assumption for a large segment of linguists due to the lack of studies addressing central phenomena in generative linguistics. To address this, we focus on how to learn constraints on long-distance dependencies, also known as syntactic island constraints. We use formal acceptability judgment data to identify the target state of learning for syntactic island constraints and conduct a corpus analysis of child-directed data to affirm that there does appear to be an induction problem when learning these constraints. We then create a computational learning model that implements a learning strategy capable of successfully learning the pattern of acceptability judgments observed in formal experiments, based on realistic input. Importantly, this model does not explicitly encode syntactic constraints. We discuss learning biases required by this model in detail as they highlight the potential problems posed by syntactic island effects for any theory of syntactic acquisition. We find that, although the proposed learning strategy requires fewer complex and domain-specific components than previous theories of syntactic island learning, it still raises difficult questions about how the specific biases required by syntactic islands arise in the learner. We discuss the consequences of these results for theories of acquisition and theories of syntax.

J	Goodman, ND; Stuhlmuller, A				Goodman, Noah D.; Stuhlmueller, Andreas			Knowledge and Implicature: Modeling Language Understanding as Social Cognition	TOPICS IN COGNITIVE SCIENCE			English	Article						Language; Bayesian model; Scalar implicature		Is language understanding a special case of social cognition? To help evaluate this view, we can formalize it as the rational speech-act theory: Listeners assume that speakers choose their utterances approximately optimally, and listeners interpret an utterance by using Bayesian inference to invert this model of the speaker. We apply this framework to model scalar implicature (some implies not all, and N implies not more than N). This model predicts an interaction between the speaker's knowledge state and the listener's interpretation. We test these predictions in two experiments and find good fit between model predictions and human judgments.

Since the introduction of FODA in 1990, several variability modeling languages have been proposed in academia and industry, followed by hundreds of research papers on variability models and modeling. However, little is known about the practical use of such languages. We study the constructs, semantics, usage, and associated tools of two variability modeling languages, Kconfig and CDL, which are independently developed outside academia and used in large and significant software projects. We analyze 128 variability models found in 12 open-source projects using these languages. Our study 1) supports variability modeling research with empirical data on the real-world use of its flagship concepts. However, we 2) also provide requirements for concepts and mechanisms that are not commonly considered in academic techniques, and 3) challenge assumptions about size and complexity of variability models made in academic papers. These results are of interest to researchers working on variability modeling and analysis techniques and to designers of tools, such as feature dependency checkers and interactive product configurators.

This could enable new tools for developing code, encouraging reuse, and navigating large projects. In this paper, we build the first giga-token probabilistic language model of source code, based on 352 million lines of Java. This is 100 times the scale of the pioneering work by Hindle et al. The giga-token model is significantly better at the code suggestion task than previous models. More broadly, our approach provides a new ""lens"" for analyzing software projects, enabling new complexity metrics based on statistical analysis of large corpora. We call these metrics data-driven complexity metrics. We propose new metrics that measure the complexity of a code module and the topical centrality of a module to a software project. In particular, it is possible to distinguish reusable utility classes from classes that are part of a program's core logic based solely on general information theoretic criteria."

While feed-forward networks are able to take into account only a fixed context length to predict the next word, recurrent neural networks (RNN) can take advantage of all previous words. Due the difficulties in training of RNN, the way could be in using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network architecture. In this work, we show an application of LSTM network with extensions on a language modelling task with Czech spontaneous phone calls. Experiments show considerable improvements in perplexity and WER on recognition system over n-gram baseline.

J	Putnam, MT; Sanchez, L				Putnam, Michael T.; Sanchez, Liliana			What's so incomplete about incomplete acquisition? A prolegomenon to modeling heritage language grammars	LINGUISTIC APPROACHES TO BILINGUALISM			English	Article						Incomplete acquisition; heritage grammars; first-language attrition; tense; mood; aspect	SPANISH; INTERFERENCE; REALIZATION; ENGLISH	Modeling the competence grammar of heritage speakers who exhibit low proficiency in their L1 represents a significant challenge for generative and experimental approaches to bilingual linguistic research. In this paper we revisit the core tenets of the incomplete acquisition hypothesis as developed in recent scholarship (in particular by Montrul (2002 et seq.) and Polinsky (1997, 2006)). Although we adopt many of these fundamental aspects of this research program, in this article we develop an alternative model that provides a more accurate depiction of the process that leads to what these scholars describe as the (later) effects of incomplete acquisition, thus improving the predictive power of this research program.

Modeling language and cognition with deep unsupervised learning: a tutorial overview	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						neural networks; connectionist modeling; deep learning; hierarchical generative models; unsupervised learning; visual word recognition	PROBABILISTIC MODELS; CONNECTIONIST; REPRESENTATIONS; ORGANIZATION; RECOGNITION; PRINCIPLES; EMERGENCE; ALGORITHM; DYSLEXIA; WORDS	Deep unsupervised learning in stochastic recurrent neural networks with many layers of hidden units is a recent breakthrough in neural computation research. These networks build a hierarchy of progressively more complex distributed representations of the sensory data by fitting a hierarchical generative model. In this article we discuss the theoretical foundations of this approach and we review key issues related to training, testing and analysis of deep networks for modeling language and cognitive processing. The classic letter and word perception problem of McClelland and Rumelhart (1981) is used as a tutorial example to illustrate how structured and abstract representations may emerge from deep generative learning. We argue that the focus on deep architectures and generative (rather than discriminative) learning represents a crucial step forward for the connectionist modeling enterprise, because it offers a more plausible model of cortical learning as well as a way to bridge the gap between emergentist connectionist models and structured Bayesian models of cognition.

In this paper, we investigate language modeling for conversational Mandarin-English code-switching (CS) speech recognition. First, we investigate the prediction of code switches based on textual features with focus on Part-of-Speech (POS) tags and trigger words. Second, we propose a structure of recurrent neural networks to predict code-switches. We extend the networks by adding POS information to the input layer and by factorizing the output layer into languages. The resulting models are applied to our task of code-switching language modeling. The final performance shows 10.8% relative improvement in perplexity on the SEAME development set which transforms into a 2% relative improvement in terms of Mixed Error Rate and a relative improvement of 16.9% in perplexity on the evaluation set which leads to a 2.7% relative improvement of MER.

First, the relationship between language anxiety and motivation was examined among Iranian EFL learners. Secondly, a foreign language achievement model based on language learning anxiety and motivation was developed and tested by structural equation modeling. To achieve the purposes, foreign language classroom anxiety scale (FLCAS) and language learning orientations scale (LLOS) were administered to 264 participants. The results of the study showed that amotivation and less self-determined types of external motivation are positively related to language anxiety. Also, intrinsic motivation and identified regulation were negatively related to language anxiety. The application of the structural equation modeling showed that both anxiety and motivation significantly predict the English achievement of the language learners within an Iranian context. Pedagogical implications of the results are discussed.

However, due to the size of such modeling initiatives, they often struggle with the quality assurance of their model collections. While many model properties can already be checked automatically, there is a notable gap of techniques for checking linguistic aspects such as naming conventions of process model elements. In this paper, we address this problem by introducing an automatic technique for detecting violations of naming conventions. This technique is based on text corpora and independent of linguistic resources such as WordNet Therefore, it can be easily adapted to the broad set of languages for which corpora exist. We demonstrate the applicability of the technique by analyzing nine process model collections from practice, including over 27,000 labels and covering three different languages. The results of the evaluation show that our technique yields stable results and can reliably deal with ambiguous cases. In this way, this paper provides an important contribution to the field of automated quality assurance of conceptual models. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Representing term dependencies and defining a scoring function capable of integrating such additional evidence is theoretically and practically challenging. Recently, Quantum Theory (QT) has been proposed as a possible, more general framework for IR. However, only a limited number of investigations have been made and the potential of QT has not been fully explored and tested. We develop a new, generalized Language Modeling approach for IR by adopting the probabilistic framework of QT. In particular, quantum probability could account for both single and compound terms at once without having to extend the term space artificially as in previous studies. This naturally allows us to avoid the weight-normalization problem, which arises in the current practice by mixing scores from matching compound terms and from matching single terms. Our model is the first practical application of quantum probability to show significant improvements over a robust bag-of-words baseline and achieves better performance on a stronger non bag-of-words baseline.

Phonological deficits in specific language impairment and developmental dyslexia: towards a multidimensional model	BRAIN			English	Article						specific language impairment; dyslexia; phonology; morphology; syntax	NON-WORD REPETITION; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; LEARNING-DISABILITIES; CAUSAL CONNECTION; READING DISORDERS; GRAMMATICAL-SLI; CHILDREN; SKILLS; DIFFICULTIES; MORPHOLOGY	An on-going debate surrounds the relationship between specific language impairment and developmental dyslexia, in particular with respect to their phonological abilities. Are these distinct disorders? To what extent do they overlap? Which cognitive and linguistic profiles correspond to specific language impairment, dyslexia and comorbid cases? At least three different models have been proposed: the severity model, the additional deficit model and the component model. We address this issue by comparing children with specific language impairment only, those with dyslexia-only, those with specific language impairment and dyslexia and those with no impairment, using a broad test battery of language skills. We find that specific language impairment and dyslexia do not always co-occur, and that some children with specific language impairment do not have a phonological deficit. Using factor analysis, we find that language abilities across the four groups of children have at least three independent sources of variance: one for non-phonological language skills and two for distinct sets of phonological abilities (which we term phonological skills versus phonological representations). Furthermore, children with specific language impairment and dyslexia show partly distinct profiles of phonological deficit along these two dimensions. We conclude that a multiple-component model of language abilities best explains the relationship between specific language impairment and dyslexia and the different profiles of impairment that are observed.

Despite the high cost of human oracle involvement, there has been little research investigating how to make the role easier and less time-consuming. One source of human oracle cost is the inherent unreadability of machine-generated test inputs. In particular, automatically generated string inputs tend to be arbitrary sequences of characters that are awkward to read. This makes test cases hard to comprehend and time-consuming to check. In this paper we present an approach in which a natural language model is incorporated into a search-based input data generation process with the aim of improving the human readability of generated strings. We further present a human study of test inputs generated using the technique on 17 open source Java case studies. For 10 of the case studies, the participants recorded significantly faster times when evaluating inputs produced using the language model, with medium to large effect sizes 60% of the time. In addition, the study found that accuracy of test input evaluation was also significantly improved for 3 of the case studies.

Like similar approaches, the IEC 61499 language does not define how functional hierarchies of upper-and lower-level functional entities should be built. In this paper we outline structuring principles for IEC 61499 programs with purely hierarchical control architectures. We present elementary design guidelines for structuring automation solutions in several hierarchical layers, outline which elements of the IEC 61499 language to use, discuss patterns that arise when implementing hierarchical control solutions, and illustrate the approach with a case study.

This model is able to handle arbitrarily-sized vocabularies, hence dispensing with the need for shortlists that are commonly used in NNLMs. Several softmax layers replace the standard output layer in this model. The output structure depends on the word clustering which is based on the continuous word representation determined by the NNLM. Mandarin and Arabic data are used to evaluate the SOUL NNLM accuracy via speech-to-text experiments. Well tuned speech-to-text systems (with error rates around 10%) serve as the baselines. The SOUL model achieves consistent improvements over a classical shortlist NNLM both in terms of perplexity and recognition accuracy for these two languages that are quite different in terms of their internal structure and recognition vocabulary size. An enhanced training scheme is proposed that allows more data to be used at each training iteration of the neural network.

COMPARISON OF FEEDFORWARD AND RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK LANGUAGE MODELS	2013 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ACOUSTICS, SPEECH AND SIGNAL PROCESSING (ICASSP)	International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing ICASSP		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	MAY 26-31, 2013	Vancouver, CANADA			Automatic speech recognition; feedforward neural networks; recurrent neural networks		Research on language modeling for speech recognition has increasingly focused on the application of neural networks. Two competing concepts have been developed: On the one hand, feedforward neural networks representing an n-gram approach, on the other hand recurrent neural networks that may learn context dependencies spanning more than a fixed number of predecessor words. To the best of our knowledge, no comparison has been carried out between feedforward and state-of-the-art recurrent networks when applied to speech recognition. This paper analyzes this aspect in detail on a well-tuned French speech recognition task. In addition, we propose a simple and efficient method to normalize language model probabilities across different vocabularies, and we show how to speed up training of recurrent neural networks by parallelization.

We present this overview by recounting a series of our prior collaborative projects that have employed and developed various forms of topic models to understand language differentiation in academe. With each project, we encountered a variety of model-specific issues concerning the validity of topics and their suitability to our data and research questions. We developed a variety of novel visualization techniques to make sense of topic-solutions and used a variety of techniques to validate our results. In addition, we created a variety of new topic modeling techniques and procedures suitable to different kinds of data and research questions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was to describe growth trajectories of linguistic, motor and cognitive skills among ELGA children, compared to full-term (FT) peers, from the first to the third year of life, a crucial period for development. Growth curve analysis was used to examine individual and group differences in terms of initial status at 12 months and rate of growth through the second and the third year of life with five points of assessment. Twenty-eight monolingual Italian children, of whom 17 were ELGA (mean GA 25.7 weeks) and 11 were FT children, were assessed through the BSID-III at 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months for language skills and at 12, 24 and 30 months for motor and cognitive skills. ELGA children presented significantly lower scores than FT peers in language, motor and cognitive skills and they did not overcome their disadvantage by 3 years, even if their corrected age was taken into account. Concerning growth curves, in motor development a significant increasing divergence was found showing a Matthew effect with the preterm sample falling further behind the FT sample. In linguistic and cognitive development, instead, a stable gap between the two samples was found. In addition, great inter-individual differences in rate of change were observed for language development in both samples. Our findings highlight the theoretical and clinical relevance of analyzing, through growth curve analyses, the developmental trajectories of ELGA children in language skills taking into account their inter-individual variability also across motor and cognitive domains. Learning outcomes: After reading this article, the reader will interpret: (a) characteristics and growth trajectories of ELGA children from the first to the third year of life with respect to FT children in language, motor and cognitive development; (b) the method of growth curve analyses to describe group as well as inter-individual trajectories; (c) the rate of inter-individual variability in language as well as motor and cognitive skills, which gives useful indications for early interventions.

Language switching in bilingual production: Empirical data and computational modelling	BILINGUALISM-LANGUAGE AND COGNITION			English	Article						bilingualism; speech production; switching; computational modelling	LEXICAL SELECTION; SPEECH PRODUCTION; NATIVE LANGUAGE; ACQUISITION; ACCESS; COSTS	One key issue in bilingualism is how bilinguals control production, particularly to produce words in the less dominant language. Language switching is one method to investigate control processes. Language switching has been much studied in comprehension, e. g., in lexical decision task, but less so in production. Here we first present a study of language switching in Italian-English adult bilinguals in a naming task for visually presented words. We demonstrate an asymmetric pattern of time costs to switch language, where participants incurred a greater time cost to switch into naming in their dominant language (Italian). In addition, costs were greater where the stimuli were interlingual cognates or homographs than words existing in only one language, implicating lexical competition as a source of the cost. To clarify the operation of control processes, we then present two connectionist models of bilingual naming, based on the previous models of Seidenberg and McClelland (1989), Cohen, Dunbar and McClelland (1990), Gilbert and Shallice (2002), and Karaminis and Thomas (2010). Crucially, both models acquired their differential language dominance via an experience-dependent learning process. The models embody different assumptions about the language control processes that produce the switch cost. We consider which processing assumptions are sufficient to explain asymmetric language switch costs and word class effects on language switching in individual word reading, as well as generating novel predictions for future testing.

Unfortunately, while several researchers have introduced the notion of roles to modeling and programming languages, only few have captured both the relational and the context-dependent nature of roles. In this work, we classify various proposals since 2000 and show the discontinuity and fragmentation of the whole research field. To overcome discontinuity, we propose a family of metamodels for role-based modeling languages. Each family member corresponds to a design decision captured in a feature model. In this way, it becomes feasible to generate a metamodel for each role-based approach. This allows for the combination and improvement of the different role-based modeling and programming languages and paves the way to reconcile the research field.

We discuss four predictions of these models: (a) correlation between domain-general abilities (e.g. sequential learning) and language-specific mechanisms (e.g. word order processing); (b) coevolution of language and relevant competences (e.g. joint attention); (c) effects of cultural transmission and social structure on linguistic understandability; and (d) commonalities between linguistic, biological, and physical phenomena. All these contribute significantly to our understanding of the evolutions of language structures, individual learning mechanisms, and relevant biological and socio-cultural factors. We conclude the survey by highlighting three future directions of modelling studies of language evolution: (a) adopting experimental approaches for model evaluation; (b) consolidating empirical foundations of models; and (c) multi-disciplinary collaboration among modelling, linguistics, and other relevant disciplines.

Brain-Computer Interface With Language Model-Electroencephalography Fusion for Locked-In Syndrome	NEUROREHABILITATION AND NEURAL REPAIR			English	Article						brain-computer interface; locked-in syndrome; language model; electroencephalography (EEG); neuroengineering	ALTERNATIVE COMMUNICATION; REHABILITATION; TECHNOLOGY; IMPAIRMENT; KEYBOARD; PEOPLE; ACCESS; HEAD	Background. Some noninvasive brain-computer interface (BCI) systems are currently available for locked-in syndrome (LIS) but none have incorporated a statistical language model during text generation. Objective. To begin to address the communication needs of individuals with LIS using a noninvasive BCI that involves rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) of symbols and a unique classifier with electroencephalography (EEG) and language model fusion. Methods. The RSVP Keyboard was developed with several unique features. Individual letters are presented at 2.5 per second. Computer classification of letters as targets or nontargets based on EEG is performed using machine learning that incorporates a language model for letter prediction via Bayesian fusion enabling targets to be presented only 1 to 4 times. Nine participants with LIS and 9 healthy controls were enrolled. After screening, subjects first calibrated the system, and then completed a series of balanced word generation mastery tasks that were designed with 5 incremental levels of difficulty, which increased by selecting phrases for which the utility of the language model decreased naturally. Results. Six participants with LIS and 9 controls completed the experiment. All LIS participants successfully mastered spelling at level 1 and one subject achieved level 5. Six of 9 control participants achieved level 5. Conclusions. Individuals who have incomplete LIS may benefit from an EEG-based BCI system, which relies on EEG classification and a statistical language model. Steps to further improve the system are discussed.

Conceptual modeling of natural language functional requirements	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE			English	Article						Automated requirements analysis; Conceptual modeling; Natural language processing; Syntactic analysis		Requirements analysts consider a conceptual model to be an important artifact created during the requirements analysis phase of a software development life cycle (SDLC). A conceptual, or domain model is a visual model of the requirements domain in focus. Owing to its visual nature, the model serves as a platform for the deliberation of requirements by stakeholders and enables requirements analysts to further refine the functional requirements. Conceptual models may evolve into class diagrams during the design and execution phases of the software project. Even a partially automated conceptual model can save significant time during the requirements phase, by quickening the process of graphical communication and visualization. This paper presents a system to create a conceptual model from functional specifications, written in natural language in an automated manner. Classes and relationships are automatically identified from the functional specifications. This identification is based on the analysis of the grammatical constructs of sentences, and on Object Oriented principles of design. Extended entity-relationship (EER) notations are incorporated into the class relationships. Optimizations are applied to the identified entities during a post-processing stage, and the final conceptual model is rendered. The use of typed dependencies, combined with rules to derive class relationships offers a granular approach to the extraction of the design elements in the model. The paper illustrates the model creation process using a standard case study, and concludes with an evaluation of the usefulness of this approach for the requirements analysis. The analysis is conducted against both standard published models and conceptual models created by humans, for various evaluation parameters. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Software process modeling languages: A systematic literature review	INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY			English	Review						Software process modeling; Software process language; Systematic literature review	SPEM EXTENSION; UML4SPM; UML	Context: Organizations working in software development are aware that processes are very important assets as well as they are very conscious of the need to deploy well-defined processes with the goal of improving software product development and, particularly, quality. Software process modeling languages are an important support for describing and managing software processes in software-intensive organizations. Objective: This paper seeks to identify what software process modeling languages have been defined in last decade, the relationships and dependencies among them and, starting from the current state, to define directions for future research. Method: A systematic literature review was developed. 1929 papers were retrieved by a manual search in 9 databases and 46 primary studies were finally included. Results: Since 2000 more than 40 languages have been first reported, each of which with a concrete purpose. We show that different base technologies have been used to define software process modeling languages. We provide a scheme where each language is registered together with the year it was created, the base technology used to define it and whether it is considered a starting point for later languages. This scheme is used to illustrate the trend in software process modeling languages. Finally, we present directions for future research. Conclusion: This review presents the different software process modeling languages that have been developed in the last ten years, showing the relevant fact that model-based SPMLs (Software Process Modeling Languages) are being considered as a current trend. Each one of these languages has been designed with a particular motivation, to solve problems which had been detected. However, there are still several problems to face, which have become evident in this review. This let us provide researchers with some guidelines for future research on this topic.

Distributional Language Learning: Mechanisms and Models of Category Formation	LANGUAGE LEARNING			English	Article						statistical learning; rule learning; generalization; grammatical categories; infancy; child language	STATISTICAL COMPUTATIONS; GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES; 8-MONTH-OLD INFANTS; TONE SEQUENCES; SPEECH STREAM; SEGMENTATION; CUES; DEPENDENCIES; VOCABULARY; CONSONANTS	In the past 15 years, a substantial body of evidence has confirmed that a powerful distributional learning mechanism is present in infants, children, adults and (at least to some degree) in nonhuman animals as well. The present article briefly reviews this literature and then examines some of the fundamental questions that must be addressed for any distributional learning mechanism to operate effectively within the linguistic domain. In particular, how does a naive learner determine the number of categories that are present in a corpus of linguistic input and what distributional cues enable the learner to assign individual lexical items to those categories? Contrary to the hypothesis that distributional learning and category (or rule) learning are separate mechanisms, the present article argues that these two seemingly different processes-acquiring specific structure from linguistic input and generalizing beyond that input to novel exemplars-actually represent a single mechanism. Evidence in support of this single-mechanism hypothesis comes from a series of artificial grammar-learning studies that not only demonstrate that adults can learn grammatical categories from distributional information alone, but that the specific patterning of distributional information among attested utterances in the learning corpus enables adults to generalize to novel utterances or to restrict generalization when unattested utterances are consistently absent from the learning corpus. Finally, a computational model of distributional learning that accounts for the presence or absence of generalization is reviewed and the implications of this model for linguistic-category learning are summarized.

Neural network language models for off-line handwriting recognition	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Handwritten text recognition (HTR); Language models (LMs); Neural networks (NNs); Neural network language model (NN LM); Bidirectional long short-term memory neural networks (BLSTM); Hybrid HMM/ANN models; ROVER combination	MARKOV-MODELS	Unconstrained off-line continuous handwritten text recognition is a very challenging task which has been recently addressed by different promising techniques. This work presents our latest contribution to this task, integrating neural network language models in the decoding process of three state-of-the-art systems: one based on bidirectional recurrent neural networks, another based on hybrid hidden Markov models and, finally, a combination of both. Experimental results obtained on the IAM off-line database demonstrate that consistent word error rate reductions can be achieved with neural network language models when compared with statistical N-gram language models on the three tested systems. The best word error rate, 16.1%, reported with ROVER combination of systems using neural network language models significantly outperforms current benchmark results for the IAM database.

J	Dornyei, Z				Doernyei, Zoltan			Researching complex dynamic systems: 'Retrodictive qualitative modelling' in the language classroom	LANGUAGE TEACHING			English	Article							EMERGENCE	While approaching second language acquisition from a complex dynamic systems perspective makes a lot of intuitive sense, it is difficult for a number of reasons to operationalise such a dynamic approach in research terms. For example, the most common research paradigms in the social sciences tend to examine variables in relative isolation rather than as part of a system or network, and most established quantitative data analytical procedures (e.g. correlation analysis or structural equation modelling) are based on linear rather than nonlinear relationships. In this paper I will first summarise some of the main challenges of dynamic systems research in general and then present a concrete research template that can be applied to investigate instructed second language acquisition. This approach involves a special type of qualitative system modelling - retrodictive qualitative modelling' - that reverses the usual research direction by starting at the end - the system outcomes - and then tracing back to see why certain components of the system ended up with one outcome option and not another. By way of illustration I will provide examples from two classroom-oriented research projects in which the language classroom was taken to be the dynamic system, and the system outcome options were the various learner prototypes (e.g. motivated, laid back, passive) observed in the classroom.

However, it is difficult to apply these models if the underlying search space is large. In this paper, we combine previous work on lattice decoding with long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network language 'models. By adding refined pruning techniques, we are able to reduce the search effort by a factor of three. Furthermore, we introduce two novel approximations for full lattice rescoring, which opens the potential of lattice-based speech recognition techniques. Compared to 1000-best lists, we find that we can increase the word error rate improvements obtained with LSTMs from 8.2 % to 10.7 % relative over a stateof-the-art baseline, while the resulting lattices are even considerably smaller. In addition, we investigate the use of LSTMs for Babel Assamese keyword search, obtaining significant improvements of 2.5 % relative.

We investigate the effect of phone merging on multilingual DNN in context of rapid language adaptation. Moreover, the combination of multilingual DNNs with Kullback-Leibler divergence based acoustic modeling (KL-HMM) is explored. Using ten different languages from the Globalphone database, our studies reveal that crosslingual acoustic model transfer through multilingual DNNs is superior to unsupervised RBM pre-training and greedy layer-wise supervised training. We also found that KL-HMM based decoding consistently outperforms conventional hybrid decoding, especially in low-resource scenarios. Furthermore, the experiments indicate that multilingual DNN training equally benefits from simple phoneset concatenation and manually derived universal phonesets.

An imagetext multimodal neural language model can be used to retrieve images given complex sentence queries, retrieve phrase descriptions given image queries, as well as generate text conditioned on images We show that in the case of image-text modelling we can jointly learn word representations and image features by training our models together with a convolutional network. Unlike many of the existing methods, our approach can generate sentence descriptions for images without the use of templates, structured prediction, and/or syntactic trees. While we focus on imagetext modelling, our algorithms can be easily applied to other modalities such as audio.

Most BCIs have to undergo a calibration session in which data is recorded to train decoders with machine learning. Only recently zero-training methods have become a subject of study. This work proposes a probabilistic framework for BCI applications which exploit event-related potentials (ERPs). For the example of a visual P300 speller we show how the framework harvests the structure suitable to solve the decoding task by (a) transfer learning, (b) unsupervised adaptation, (c) language model and (d) dynamic stopping. Approach. A simulation study compares the proposed probabilistic zero framework (using transfer learning and task structure) to a state-of-the-art supervised model on n = 22 subjects. The individual influence of the involved components (a)-(d) are investigated. Main results. Without any need for a calibration session, the probabilistic zero-training framework with inter-subject transfer learning shows excellent performance-competitive to a state-of-the-art supervised method using calibration. Its decoding quality is carried mainly by the effect of transfer learning in combination with continuous unsupervised adaptation. Significance. A high-performing zero-training BCI is within reach for one of the most popular BCI paradigms: ERP spelling. Recording calibration data for a supervised BCI would require valuable time which is lost for spelling. The time spent on calibration would allow a novel user to spell 29 symbols with our unsupervised approach. It could be of use for various clinical and non-clinical ERP-applications of BCI.

We studied structural-functional relationships by correlating the types of language disturbances generated by stimulation in awake patients, mimicking a transient virtual lesion both at cortical and subcortical levels (white matter and deep grey nuclei), with the anatomical location of the stimulation probe. We propose a hodotopical (delocalized) and dynamic model of language processing, which challenges the traditional modular and serial view. According to this model, following the visual input, the language network is organized in parallel, segregated (even if interconnected) large-scale cortico-subcortical sub-networks underlying semantic, phonological and syntactic processing. Our model offers several advantages (i) it explains double dissociations during stimulation (comprehension versus naming disorders, semantic versus phonemic paraphasias, syntactic versus naming disturbances, pluri-modal judgment versus naming disorders); (ii) it takes into account the cortical and subcortical anatomic constraints; (iii) it explains the possible recovery of aphasia following a lesion within the ""classical"" language areas; (iv) it establishes links with a model executive functions.

Given a program with holes, we synthesize completions for holes with the most likely sequences of method calls. Our main idea is to reduce the problem of code completion to a natural-language processing problem of predicting probabilities of sentences. We design a simple and scalable static analysis that extracts sequences of method calls from a large codebase, and index these into a statistical language model. We then employ the language model to find the highest ranked sentences, and use them to synthesize a code completion. Our approach is able to synthesize sequences of calls across multiple objects together with their arguments. Experiments show that our approach is fast and effective. Virtually all computed completions typecheck, and the desired completion appears in the top 3 results in 90% of the cases.

Our system explores an open-ended space of statistical models to discover a good explanation of a data set, and then produces a detailed report with figures and natural language text. Our approach treats unknown regression functions non-parametrically using Gaussian processes, which has two important consequences. First, Gaussian processes can model functions in terms of high-level properties (e.g. smoothness, trends, periodicity, changepoints). Taken together with the compositional structure of our language of models this allows us to automatically describe functions in simple terms. Second, the use of flexible nonparametric models and a rich language for composing them in an open-ended manner also results in state-of-the-art extrapolation performance evaluated over 13 real time series data sets from various domains.

These enhancements fall into two categories. First, we describe how we filtered publicly available monolingual data and used it to estimate well-suited language models (LMs), using open-source tools. Then, we describe the process of selection we applied to new acoustic data from TED talks, providing additions to our previously released corpus. Finally, we report some experiments we made around these improvements.

This release improves upon the Google n-gram counts in two key ways: the inclusion of low-count entries and deduplication to reduce boilerplate. By preserving singletons, we were able to use Kneser-Ney smoothing to build large language models. This paper describes how the corpus was processed with emphasis on the problems that arise in working with data at this scale. Our unpruned Kneser-Ney English 5-gram language model, built on 975 billion deduplicated tokens, contains over 500 billion unique n-grams. We show gains of 0.5-1.4 BLEU by using large language models to translate into various languages.

The arcuate fasciculus is a central connection in this architecture, linking regions devoted to formal aspects of language with regions involved in intentional and social communication. Here, we outline a new anatomical model of communication that incorporates previous neurofunctional accounts of language with recent advances in tractography and neuropragmatics. The model consists of five levels, from the representation of informative actions and communicative intentions, to lexical/semantic processing, syntactic analysis, and pragmatic integration. The structure of the model is hierarchical in relation to developmental and evolutionary trajectories and it may help interpreting clinico-anatomical correlation in communication disorders.

Angus			LEMS: a language for expressing complex biological models in concise and hierarchical form and its use in underpinning NeuroML 2	FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article						model description language; standardization; simulation; spiking neural networks; model sharing	SYSTEMS BIOLOGY; NEURAL-NETWORKS; SIMULATION; SPECIFICATION; MECHANISMS; DATABASE; TOOLS; LAYER	Computational models are increasingly important for studying complex neurophysiological systems. As scientific tools, it is essential that such models can be reproduced and critically evaluated by a range of scientists. However, published models are currently implemented using a diverse set of modeling approaches, simulation tools, and computer languages making them inaccessible and difficult to reproduce. Models also typically contain concepts that are tightly linked to domain-specific simulators, or depend on knowledge that is described exclusively in text-based documentation. To address these issues we have developed a compact, hierarchical, XML-based language called LEMS (Low Entropy Model Specification), that can define the structure and dynamics of a wide range of biological models in a fully machine readable format. We describe how LEMS underpins the latest version of NeuroML and show that this framework can define models of ion channels, synapses, neurons and networks. Unit handling, often a source of error when reusing models, is built into the core of the language by specifying physical quantities in models in terms of the base dimensions. We show how LEMS, together with the open source Java and Python based libraries we have developed, facilitates the generation of scripts for multiple neuronal simulators and provides a route for simulator free code generation. We establish that LEMS can be used to define models from systems biology and map them to neuroscience-domain specific simulators, enabling models to be shared between these traditionally separate disciplines. LEMS and NeuroML 2 provide a new, comprehensive framework for defining computational models of neuronal and other biological systems in a machine readable format, making them more reproducible and increasing the transparency and accessibility of their underlying structure and properties.

Effects of the Teach-Model-Coach-Review Instructional Approach on Caregiver Use of Language Support Strategies and Children's Expressive Language Skills	JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH			English	Article						early intervention; language disorders; effectiveness	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; INTERVENTION; AUTISM; PARENTS; STIMULATION; TODDLERS; DELAY; RISK	Purpose: In this study, the authors examined the effects of the Teach-Model-Coach-Review instructional approach on caregivers' use of four enhanced milieu teaching (EMT) language support strategies and on their children's use of expressive language. Method: Four caregiver-child dyads participated in a singlesubject, multiple-baseline study. Children were between 24 and 42 months of age and had language impairment. Interventionists used the Teach-Model-Coach-Review instructional approach to teach caregivers to use matched turns, expansions, time delays, and milieu teaching prompts during 24 individualized clinic sessions. Caregiver use of each EMT language support strategy and child use of communication targets were the dependent variables. Results: The caregivers demonstrated increases in their use of each EMT language support strategy after instruction. Generalization and maintenance of strategy use to the home was limited, indicating that teaching across routines is necessary to achieve maximal outcomes. All children demonstrated gains in their use of communication targets and in their performance on norm-referenced measures of language. Conclusion: The results indicate that the Teach-Model-Coach-Review instructional approach resulted in increased use of EMT language support strategies by caregivers. Caregiver use of these strategies was associated with positive changes in child language skills.

J	Leopold, H; Mendling, J; Polyvyanyy, A				Leopold, Henrik; Mendling, Jan; Polyvyanyy, Artem			Supporting Process Model Validation through Natural Language Generation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Business process model validation; natural language text generation; verbalization	SPECIFICATIONS; VERIFICATION; SEMANTICS; ERRORS; NETS; TEXT	The design and development of process-aware information systems is often supported by specifying requirements as business process models. Although this approach is generally accepted as an effective strategy, it remains a fundamental challenge to adequately validate these models given the diverging skill set of domain experts and system analysts. As domain experts often do not feel confident in judging the correctness and completeness of process models that system analysts create, the validation often has to regress to a discourse using natural language. In order to support such a discourse appropriately, so-called verbalization techniques have been defined for different types of conceptual models. However, there is currently no sophisticated technique available that is capable of generating natural-looking text from process models. In this paper, we address this research gap and propose a technique for generating natural language texts from business process models. A comparison with manually created process descriptions demonstrates that the generated texts are superior in terms of completeness, structure, and linguistic complexity. An evaluation with users further demonstrates that the texts are very understandable and effectively allow the reader to infer the process model semantics. Hence, the generated texts represent a useful input for process model validation.

However, according to a recent proposal, a ventral pathway underpinned by extreme capsule (EmC) and uncinate fasciculus (UP) fiber tracts is primarily responsible for language production, whereas the AF primarily underlies repetition. Here, a computational implementation of the dorsal-pathway account of language production is presented, called WEAVER++/ARC (for WEAVER++ Arcuate Repetition and Conversation), which synthesizes behavioral psycholinguistic, functional neuroimaging, and tractographic evidence. The results of computer simulations revealed that the model accounts for the typical patterns of impaired and spared language performance associated with classic acute-onset and progressive aphasias. Moreover, the model accounts for recent evidence that damage to the AF but not the EmC/UF pathway predicts impaired production performance. It is concluded that the results demonstrate the viability of a dorsal-pathway account of language production. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Our approach is evaluated in the context of log-bilinear language models, rendered suitably efficient for implementation inside a machine translation decoder by factoring the vocabulary. We perform both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations, presenting results on a range of languages which demonstrate that our model learns morphological representations that both perform well on word similarity tasks and lead to substantial reductions in perplexity. When used for translation into morphologically rich languages with large vocabularies, our models obtain improvements of up to 1.2 BLEU points relative to a baseline system using back-off n-gram models.

A hemispheric functional lateralization index (HFLI) for language was derived from fMRI acquired during a covert sentence generation task as compared with a covert word list recitation. The multimodal HFLI distribution was optimally modeled using a mixture of 3 and 4 Gaussian functions in right-handers (RH) and LH, respectively. Gaussian function parameters helped to define 3 types of language hemispheric lateralization, namely ""Typical'' (left hemisphere dominance with clear positive HFLI values, 88% of RH, 78% of LH), ""Ambilateral'' (no dominant hemisphere with HFLI values close to 0, 12% of RH, 15% of LH) and ""Strongly-atypical'' (right-hemisphere dominance with clear negative HFLI values, 7% of LH). Concordance between dominant hemispheres for hand and for language did not exceed chance level, and most of the association between handedness and language lateralization was explained by the fact that all Strongly-atypical individuals were left-handed. Similarly, most of the relationship between language lateralization and manual preference strength was explained by the fact that Strongly-atypical individuals exhibited a strong preference for their left hand. These results indicate that concordance of hemispheric dominance for hand and for language occurs barely above the chance level, except in a group of rare individuals (less than 1% in the general population) who exhibit strong right hemisphere dominance for both language and their preferred hand. They call for a revisit of models hypothesizing common determinants for handedness and for language dominance."

The aim is to bring together recent work on statistical modelling of source code and work on bimodal models of images and natural language. The resulting models are useful for a variety of tasks that involve natural language and source code. We demonstrate their performance on two retrieval tasks: retrieving source code snippets given a natural language query, and retrieving natural language descriptions given a source code query (i.e., source code captioning). Experiments show there to be promise in this direction, and that modelling the structure of source code improves performance.

J	Levinson, SC; Torreira, F				Levinson, Stephen C.; Torreira, Francisco			Timing in turn-taking and its implications for processing models of language	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						turn-taking; conversation; language processing; language production; language comprehension	TIME-COURSE; AMERICAN ENGLISH; CONVERSATIONS; ORGANIZATION; INTONATION; SENTENCES; OVERLAPS; SPEAKERS; SIGNALS; SILENCE	The core niche for language use is in verbal interaction, involving the rapid exchange of turns at talking. This paper reviews the extensive literature about this system, adding new statistical analyses of behavioral data where they have been missing, demonstrating that turn-taking has the systematic properties originally noted by Sacks et al. (1974; hereafter SSJ). This system poses some significant puzzles for current theories of language processing: the gaps between turns are short (of the order of 200 ms), but the latencies involved in language production are much longer (over 600 ms). This seems to imply that participants in conversation must predict (or 'project' as SSJ have it) the end of the current speaker's turn in order to prepare their response in advance. This in turn implies some overlap between production and comprehension despite their use of common processing resources. Collecting together what is known behaviorally and experimentally about the system, the space for systematic explanations of language processing for conversation can be significantly narrowed, and we sketch some first model of the mental processes involved for the participant preparing to speak next.

These theories have predominated for more than a century, but advances in neuroimaging and stimulation mapping have provided a more detailed description of the functional neuroanatomy of language. New insights have shaped modern network-based models of speech processing composed of parallel and interconnected streams involving both cortical and subcortical areas. Recent models emphasize processing in ""dorsal"" and ""ventral"" pathways, mediating phonological and semantic processing, respectively. Phonological processing occurs along a dorsal pathway, from the posterosuperior temporal to the inferior frontal cortices. On the other hand, semantic information is carried in a ventral pathway that runs from the temporal pole to the basal occipitotemporal cortex, with anterior connections. Functional MRI has poor positive predictive value in determining critical language sites and should only be used as an adjunct for preoperative planning. Cortical and subcortical mapping should be used to define functional resection boundaries in eloquent areas and remains the clinical gold standard. In tracing the historical advancements in our understanding of speech processing, the authors hope to not only provide practicing neurosurgeons with additional information that will aid in surgical planning and prevent postoperative morbidity, but also underscore the fact that neurosurgeons are in a unique position to further advance our understanding of the anatomy and functional organization of language."

J	Linck, JA; Cunnings, I				Linck, Jared A.; Cunnings, Ian			The Utility and Application of Mixed-Effects Models in Second Language Research	LANGUAGE LEARNING			English	Article						mixed-effects models; language science; second language acquisition; random effects; statistics	MULTILEVEL MODELS; STATISTICS	Second language acquisition researchers often face particular challenges when attempting to generalize study findings to the wider learner population. For example, language learners constitute a heterogeneous group, and it is not always clear how a study's findings may generalize to other individuals who may differ in terms of language background and proficiency, among many other factors. In this paper, we provide an overview of how mixed-effects models can be used to help overcome these and other issues in the field of second language acquisition. We provide an overview of the benefits of mixed-effects models and a practical example of how mixed-effects analyses can be conducted. Mixed-effects models provide second language researchers with a powerful statistical tool in the analysis of a variety of different types of data.

In this article, we propose a novel algorithm to model and recognize sign language performed in front of a Microsoft Kinect sensor. Under the assumption that some frames are expected to be both discriminative and representative in a sign language video, we first assign a binary latent variable to each frame in training videos for indicating its discriminative capability, then develop a latent support vector machine model to classify the signs, as well as localize the discriminative and representative frames in each video. In addition, we utilize the depth map together with the color image captured by the Kinect sensor to obtain a more effective and accurate feature to enhance the recognition accuracy. To evaluate our approach, we conducted experiments on both word-level sign language and sentence-level sign language. An American Sign Language dataset including approximately 2,000 word-level sign language phrases and 2,000 sentence-level sign language phrases was collected using the Kinect sensor, and each phrase contains color, depth, and skeleton information. Experiments on our dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for sign language recognition.

Understanding the functions of different brain areas has represented a major endeavor of neurosciences. Historically, brain functions have been associated with specific cortical brain areas; however, modern neuroimaging developments suggest cognitive functions are associated to networks rather than to areas. Objectives. The purpose of this paper was to analyze the connectivity of Brodmann area (BA) 37 (posterior, inferior, and temporal/fusiform gyrus) in relation to (1) language and (2) visual processing. Methods. Two meta-analyses were initially conducted (first level analysis). The first one was intended to assess the language network in which BA37 is involved. The second one was intended to assess the visual perception network. A third meta-analysis (second level analysis) was then performed to assess contrasts and convergence between the two cognitive domains (language and visual perception). The DataBase of Brainmap was used. Results. Our results support the role of BA37 in language but by means of a distinct network from the network that supports its second most important function: visual perception. Conclusion. It was concluded that left BA37 is a common node of two distinct networks-visual recognition (perception) and semantic language functions.

Recurrent Neural Network Language Model Adaptation for Multi-Genre Broadcast Speech Recognition	16TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL SPEECH COMMUNICATION ASSOCIATION (INTERSPEECH 2015), VOLS 1-5			English	Proceedings Paper	16th Annual Conference of the International-Speech-Communication-Association (INTERSPEECH 2015)	SEP 06-10, 2015	Dresden, GERMANY			speech recognition; RNNLM; language model adaptation; topic model; latent Dirichlet allocation		Recurrent neural network language models (RNNLMs) have recently become increasingly popular for many applications including speech recognition. In previous research RNNLMs have normally been trained on well-matched in-domain data. The adaptation of RNNLMs remains an open research area to be explored. In this paper, genre and topic based RNNLM adaptation techniques are investigated for a multi-genre broadcast transcription task. A number of techniques including Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis, Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes are used to extract show level topic information. These were then used as additional input to the RNNLM during training, which can facilitate unsupervised test time adaptation. Experiments using a state-of-the-art LVCSR system trained on 1000 hours of speech and more than 1 billion words of text showed adaptation could yield perplexity reductions of 8% relatively over the baseline RNNLM and small but consistent word error rate reductions.

The documents are represented as low-dimensional vectors and are jointly learned with distributed vector representations of word tokens using a hierarchical framework with two embedded neural language models. In particular, we exploit the context of documents in streams and use one of the language models to model the document sequences, and the other to model word sequences within them. The models learn continuous vector representations for both word tokens and documents such that semantically similar documents and words are close in a common vector space. We discuss extensions to our model, which can be applied to personalized recommendation and social relationship mining by adding further user layers to the hierarchy, thus learning user-specific vectors to represent individual preferences. We validated the learned representations on a public movie rating data set from MovieLens, as well as on a large-scale Yahoo News data comprising three months of user activity logs collected on Yahoo servers. The results indicate that the proposed model can learn useful representations of both documents and word tokens, outperforming the current state-of-the-art by a large margin.

Jointly Modeling Deep Video and Compositional Text to Bridge Vision and Language in a Unified Framework	PROCEEDINGS OF THE TWENTY-NINTH AAAI CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE	AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	29th Association-for-the-Advancement-of-Artificial-Intelligence (AAAI) Conference on Artificial Intelligence	JAN 25-30, 2015	Austin, TX					Recently, joint video-language modeling has been attracting more and more attention. However, most existing approaches focus on exploring the language model upon on a fixed visual model. In this paper, we propose a unified framework that jointly models video and the corresponding text sentences. The framework consists of three parts: a compositional semantics language model, a deep video model and a joint embedding model. In our language model, we propose a dependency-tree structure model that embeds sentence into a continuous vector space, which preserves visually grounded meanings and word order. In the visual model, we leverage deep neural networks to capture essential semantic information from videos. In the joint embedding model, we minimize the distance of the outputs of the deep video model and compositional language model in the joint space, and update these two models jointly. Based on these three parts, our system is able to accomplish three tasks: 1) natural language generation, and 2) video retrieval and 3) language retrieval. In the experiments, the results show our approach outperforms SVM, CRF and CCA baselines in predicting Subject-Verb Object triplet and natural sentence generation, and is better than CCA in video retrieval and language retrieval tasks.

The TPM maintains that structural proximity between the L3 and the L1 and/or the L2 determines L3 transfer. In addition to demonstrating empirical support for the TPM, this article articulates a proposal for how the mind unconsciously determines typological (structural) proximity based on linguistic cues from the L3 input stream used by the parser early on to determine holistic transfer of one previous (the L1 or the L2) system. This articulated version of the TPM is motivated by argumentation appealing to cognitive and linguistic factors. Finally, in line with the general tenets of the TPM, I ponder if and why L3 transfer might obtain differently depending on the type of bilingual (e.g. early vs. late) and proficiency level of bilingualism involved in the L3 process.

In recurrent neural networks (RNNs), contextual information from past inputs is modeled with the help of recurrent connections at the hidden layer, while Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks are RNNs that contain units that can store values for arbitrary amounts of time. While conventional unidirectional networks predict outputs from only past inputs, one can build bidirectional networks that also condition on future inputs. In this paper, we propose applying bidirectional RNNs and LSTM neural networks to language modeling for speech recognition. We discuss issues that arise when utilizing bidirectional models for speech, and compare unidirectional and bidirectional models on an English Broadcast News transcription task. We find that bidirectional RNNs significantly outperform unidirectional RNNs, but bidirectional LSTMs do not provide any further gain over their unidirectional counterparts.

It records the historical information through additional recurrent connections and therefore is very effective in capturing semantics of sentences. However, the use of RNNLM has been greatly hindered for the high computation cost in training. This work presents an FPGA implementation framework for RNNLM training acceleration. At architectural level, we improve the parallelism of RNN training scheme and reduce the computing resource requirement for computation efficiency enhancement. The hardware implementation primarily targets at reducing data communication load. A multi-thread based computation engine is utilized which can successfully mask the long memory latency and reuse frequent accessed data. The evaluation based on the Microsoft Research Sentence Completion Challenge shows that the proposed FPGA implementation outperforms traditional class-based modest-size recurrent networks and obtains 46.2% in training accuracy. Moreover, experiments at different network sizes demonstrate a great scalability of the proposed framework.

This study aimed to model the influence of teacher behaviors on learners' self-directed technology use. A conceptual model of three types of teacher support (affection support, capacity support and behavior support) that were reported to influence students' self-directed technology use for learning outside the classroom was generated based on interviews with 15 undergraduate foreign language learners. One hundred and sixty undergraduate foreign language learners were then surveyed to test the conceptual model. The path analysis of the survey data suggested that affection support influenced learner self-directed technology use through strengthened perceived usefulness, and that capacity support and behavior support influenced learner self-directed technology use through enhanced facilitating conditions and computer self-efficacy. The research findings highlight the importance of raising teachers' awareness of the different roles they can play and of enhancing their abilities to perform a combination of the roles to promote learner self-directed use of technology for learning outside the classroom.

Graph-based Statistical Language Model for Code	2015 IEEE/ACM 37TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING, VOL 1			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE/ACM 37th IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)	MAY 16-24, 2015	Florence, ITALY				SOFTWARE	n-gram statistical language model has been successfully applied to capture programming patterns to support code completion and suggestion. However, the approaches using n gram face challenges in capturing the patterns at higher levels of abstraction due to the mismatch between the sequence nature in n-grams and the structure nature of syntax and semantics in source code. This paper presents GraLan, a graph-based statistical language model and its application in code suggestion. GraLan can learn from a source code corpus and compute the appearance probabilities of any graphs given the observed (sub) graphs. We use GraLan to develop an API suggestion engine and an AST-based language model, ASTLan. ASTLan supports the suggestion of the next valid syntactic template and the detection of common syntactic templates. Our empirical evaluation on a large corpus of open-source projects has shown that our engine is more accurate in API code suggestion than the state-of-the-art approaches, and in 75% of the cases, it can correctly suggest the API with only five candidates. ASTLan also has high accuracy in suggesting the next syntactic template and is able to detect many useful and common syntactic templates.

A Word Embedding based Generalized Language Model for Information Retrieval	SIGIR 2015: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 38TH INTERNATIONAL ACM SIGIR CONFERENCE ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL			English	Proceedings Paper	38th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR)	AUG 09-13, 2015	Santiago, CHILE			Generalized Language model; Word Embedding; Word2Vec		Word2vec, a word embedding technique, has gained significant interest among researchers in natural language processing (NLP) in recent years. The embedding of the word vectors helps to identify a list of words that are used in similar contexts with respect to a given word. In this paper, we focus on the use of word embeddings for enhancing retrieval effectiveness. In particular, we construct a generalized language model, where the mutual independence between a pair of words (say t and t') no longer holds. Instead, we make use of the vector embeddings of the words to derive the transformation probabilities between words. Specifically, the event of observing a term t in the query from a document d is modeled by two distinct events, that of generating a different term t', either from the document itself or from the collection, respectively, and then eventually transforming it to the observed query term t. The first event of generating an intermediate term from the document intends to capture how well a term fits contextually within a document, whereas the second one of generating it from the collection aims to address the vocabulary mismatch problem by taking into account other related terms in the collection. Our experiments, conducted on the standard TREC 6-8 ad hoc and Robust tasks, show that our proposed method yields significant improvements over language model (LM) and LDA-smoothed LM baselines.

The ease of language understanding (FLU) model (Ronnberg et al., 2013) stands as one of the few attempts to offer a fully encompassing framework for language understanding. In this paper we discuss interactions between perceptual, linguistic, and cognitive factors in spoken language understanding. Central to our presentation is an examination of aspects of the FLU model that apply especially to spoken language comprehension in adult aging, where speed of processing, working memory capacity, and hearing acuity are often compromised. We discuss, in relation to the FLU model, conceptions of working memory and its capacity limitations, the use of linguistic context to aid in speech recognition and the importance of inhibitory control, and language comprehension at the sentence level. Throughout this paper we offer a constructive look at the FLU model; where it is strong and where there are gaps to be filled."

Notably, it has not yet been clarified which of the varied electrode montages investigated is the most effective in enhancing language recovery. Objective: To consider and contrast the predicted brain current flow patterns (electric field distribution) produced by varied 1 x 1 tDCS (1 anode, 1 cathode, 5 x 7 cm pad electrodes) montages used in aphasia clinical trials. Methods: A finite element model of the head of a single left frontal stroke patient was developed in order to study the pattern of the cortical EF magnitude and inward/outward radial EF under five different electrode montages: Anodal-tDCS (A-tDCS) over the left Wernicke's area (Montage A) and over the left Broca's area (Montage B); Cathodal tDCS (C-tDCS) over the right homologue of Wernicke's area (Montage C), and of Broca's area (Montage D), where for all montages A-D the ""return"" electrode was placed over the supraorbital contralateral forehead; bilateral stimulation with A-tDCS over the left Broca's and CtDCS over the right Broca's homologue (Montage E). Results: In all cases, the ""return"" electrode over the contralesional supraorbital forehead was not inert and influenced the current path through the entire brain. Montage B, although similar to montage D in focusing the current in the perilesional area, exerted the greatest effect over the left perilesional cortex, which was even stronger in montage E. Conclusions: The position and influence of both electrodes must be considered in the design and interpretation of tDCS clinical trials for aphasia. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Here, we describe the results of a collaboration between the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) and the University of Southampton, guided by the aims of the Dial-a-Molecule Grand Challenge, intended to achieve the best of both worlds and augment a discipline-agnostic ELN, LabTrove, with chemistry-specific functionality and using data provided by the ChemSpider platform. This has been done using plug-in technology to ensure maximum transferability with minimal effort of the chemistry functionality to other ELNs and equally other subject-specific functionality to LabTrove. The resulting product, ChemTrove, has undergone a usability trial by selected academics, and the resulting feedback will guide the future development of the underlying ELN technology.

The first uses a pipelined process where a set of candidate words is generated by a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on images, and then a maximum entropy (ME) language model is used to arrange these words into a coherent sentence. The second uses the penultimate activation layer of the CNN as input to a recurrent neural network (RNN) that then generates the caption sequence. In this paper, we compare the merits of these different language modeling approaches for the first time by using the same state-of-the-art CNN as input. We examine issues in the different approaches, including linguistic irregularities, caption repetition, and data set overlap. By combining key aspects of the ME and RNN methods, we achieve a new record performance over previously published results on the benchmark COCO dataset. However, the gains we see in BLEU do not translate to human judgments.

More recently, it has been found that neural networks are particularly powerful at estimating probability distributions over word sequences, giving substantial improvements over state-of-the-art count models. However, the performance of neural network language models strongly depends on their architectural structure. This paper compares count models to feedforward, recurrent, and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network variants on two large-vocabulary speech recognition tasks. We evaluate the models in terms of perplexity and word error rate, experimentally validating the strong correlation of the two quantities, which we find to hold regardless of the underlying type of the language model. Furthermore, neural networks incur an increased computational complexity compared to count models, and they differently model context dependences, often exceeding the number of words that are taken into account by count based approaches. These differences require efficient search methods for neural networks, and we analyze the potential improvements that can be obtained when applying advanced algorithms to the rescoring of word lattices on large-scale setups.

J	De Mulder, W; Bethard, S; Moens, MF				De Mulder, Wim; Bethard, Steven; Moens, Marie-Francine			A survey on the application of recurrent neural networks to statistical language modeling	COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE			English	Review						Recurrent neural networks; Natural language processing; Language modeling; Speech recognition; Machine translation	N-GRAM	In this paper, we present a survey on the application of recurrent neural networks to the task of statistical language modeling. Although it has been shown that these models obtain good performance on this task, often superior to other state-of-the-art techniques, they suffer from some important drawbacks, including a very long training time and limitations on the number of context words that can be taken into account in practice. Recent extensions to recurrent neural network models have been developed in an attempt to address these drawbacks. This paper gives an overview of the most important extensions. Each technique is described and its performance on statistical language modeling, as described in the existing literature, is discussed. Our structured overview makes it possible to detect the most promising techniques in the field of recurrent neural networks, applied to language modeling, but it also highlights the techniques for which further research is required.

The model draws on phonetic, phonological, and psycholinguistic constructs to explain a number of L2 learning scenarios. However, a recent computational implementation failed to validate a theoretical proposal for a learning scenario where the L2 has less phonemic categories than the native language (L1) along a given acoustic continuum. According to the L2LP, learners faced with this learning scenario must not only shift their old Li phoneme boundaries but also reduce the number of categories employed in perception. Our proposed revision to L2LP successfully accounts for this updating in the number of perceptual categories as a process driven by the meaning of lexical items, rather than by the learners' awareness of the number and type of phonemes that are relevant in their new language, as the previous version of L2LP assumed. Results of our simulations show that meaning-driven learning correctly predicts the developmental path of L2 phoneme perception seen in empirical studies. Additionally, and to contribute to a long-standing debate in psycholinguistics, we test two versions of the model, with the stages of phonemic perception and lexical recognition being either sequential or interactive. Both versions succeed in learning to recognize minimal pairs in the new L2, but make diverging predictions on learners' resulting phonological representations. In sum, the proposed revision to the L2LP model contributes to our understanding of L2 acquisition, with implications for speech processing in general.

(PCySeMoL)-Cy-2 includes theory on how attacks and defenses relate quantitatively; thus, users must only model their assets and how these are connected in order to enable calculations. The performance of (PCySeMoL)-Cy-2 enables quick calculations of large object models. It has been validated on both a component level and a system level using literature, domain experts, surveys, observations, experiments and case studies.

J	Roelofs, A				Roelofs, Ardi			Modeling of phonological encoding in spoken word production: From Germanic languages to Mandarin Chinese and Japanese	JAPANESE PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Review						computational modeling; implicit priming; Japanese; Mandarin Chinese; phonological encoding	SPEECH PRODUCTION; SYLLABLE-FREQUENCY; BILINGUAL SPEAKERS; MENTAL SYLLABARY; FUNCTIONAL UNIT; TIME COURSE; ORTHOGRAPHY; ARTICULATION; RETRIEVAL; MORPHEMES	It is widely assumed that spoken word production in Germanic languages like Dutch and English involves a parallel activation of phonemic segments and metrical frames in memory, followed by a serial association of segments to the frame, as implemented in the WEAVER++ model (Levelt, Roelofs, & Meyer, 1999). However, for Oriental languages like Mandarin Chinese and Japanese, researchers have suggested that the serial association concerns atonal phonological syllables (Mandarin Chinese) or moras (Japanese) to tonal frames. Here, the utility of these theoretical suggestions is demonstrated by computer simulations of key empirical findings using versions of WEAVER++ for English, Mandarin Chinese, and Japanese. The simulation outcomes suggest that, although languages may differ in the phonological structure of their words, the principles underlying phonological encoding are similar across languages.

Character-Aware Neural Language Models	THIRTIETH AAAI CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE	AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	30th Association-for-the-Advancement-of-Artificial-Intelligence (AAAI) Conference on Artificial Intelligence	FEB 12-17, 2016	Phoenix, AZ					We describe a simple neural language model that relies only on character-level inputs. Predictions are still made at the word-level. Our model employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a highway network over characters, whose output is given to a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network language model (RNN-LM). On the English Penn Treebank the model is on par with the existing state-of-the-art despite having 60% fewer parameters. On languages with rich morphology (Arabic, Czech, French, German, Spanish, Russian), the model outperforms word-level/morpheme-level LSTM baselines, again with fewer parameters. The results suggest that on many languages, character inputs are sufficient for language modeling. Analysis of word representations obtained from the character composition part of the model reveals that the model is able to encode, from characters only, both semantic and orthographic information.

In total, 304 Grade 4 children (102 Chinese-speaking Taiwanese children, 117 English-speaking Canadian children, and 85 Finnish-speaking children) were assessed on measures of RAN, speed of processing, phonological processing, orthographic processing, reading fluency, and spelling. The results of path analysis indicated that RAN had a strong direct effect on reading fluency that was of the same size across languages and that only in English was a small proportion of its predictive variance mediated by orthographic processing. In contrast, RAN did not exert a significant direct effect on spelling, and a substantial proportion of its predictive variance was mediated by phonological processing (in Chinese and Finnish) and orthographic processing (in English). Given that RAN predicted reading fluency equally well across languages and that phonological/orthographic processing had very little to do with this relationship, we argue that the reason why RAN is related to reading fluency should be sought in domain-general factors such as serial processing and articulation.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which models sequence dynamics, has attracted increasing attention on visual interpretation. However, most existing approaches generate a word locally with the given previous words and the visual content, while the relationship between sentence semantics and visual content is not holistically exploited. As a result, the generated sentences may be contextually correct but the semantics (e.g., subjects, verbs or objects) are not true. This paper presents a novel unified framework, named Long Short-Term Memory with visual-semantic Embedding (LSTM-E), which can simultaneously explore the learning of LSTM and visual-semantic embedding. The former aims to locally maximize the probability of generating the next word given previous words and visual content, while the latter is to create a visual-semantic embedding space for enforcing the relationship between the semantics of the entire sentence and visual content. The experiments on YouTube2Text dataset show that our proposed LSTM-E achieves to-date the best published performance in generating natural sentences: 45.3% and 31.0% in terms of BLEU@4 and METEOR, respectively. Superior performances are also reported on two movie description datasets (M-VAD and MPII-MD). In addition, we demonstrate that LSTM-E outperforms several state-of-the-art techniques in predicting Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) triplets.

Modeling the Contributions of Language Comprehension Skills to Reading Comprehension in the Upper Elementary Grades	SCIENTIFIC STUDIES OF READING			English	Article							MORPHOLOGICAL AWARENESS; SIMPLE VIEW; PHONOLOGICAL AWARENESS; SYNTACTIC AWARENESS; MINORITY LEARNERS; ORAL LANGUAGE; ABILITY; SPEAKING; SPANISH; DIMENSIONALITY	Language comprehension is crucial to reading. However, theoretical models and recent research raise questions about what constitutes this multifaceted domain. We present two related studies examining the dimensionality of language comprehension and relations to reading comprehension in the upper elementary grades. Studies 1 (Grade 6; N=148) and 2 (Grade 3-5; N=311) contrasted factor models of language comprehension using item level indicators of morphological awareness and vocabulary (Studies 1 and 2) and syntactic awareness (Study 2). In both studies, a bifactor modelincluding general language comprehension and specific factors for each language componentbest fit the data, and general language comprehension was the strongest predictor of reading comprehension. In Study 2, the morphology-specific factor also uniquely predicted reading comprehension above and beyond general language comprehension. Results suggest the value of modeling the common proficiency underlying performance on tasks designed to tap theoretically distinct language comprehension skills.

The cerebellum, internal models and prediction in 'non-motor' aspects of language: A critical review	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE			English	Review						Language; Prediction; Cerebellum; Internal models; Associative learning; Priming; Default-mode network	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; THETA-BURST STIMULATION; CONSCIOUS RESTING STATE; DEFAULT-MODE; MOTOR CONTROL; BRAIN-FUNCTION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; AUDITORY-FEEDBACK; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; LEXICAL DECISION	The emergence of studies on cerebellar contributions in 'non-motor' aspects of predictive language processing has long been awaited by researchers investigating the neural foundations of language and cognition. Despite (i) progress in research implicating the cerebellum in language processing, (ii) the widely-accepted nature of the uniform, multi-modal computation that the cerebellum implements in the form of internal models, as well as (iii) the long tradition of psycholinguistic studies addressing prediction mechanisms, research directly addressing cerebellar contributions to 'non-motor' predictive language processing has only surfaced in the last five years. This paper provides the first review of this novel field, along with a critical assessment of the studies conducted so far. While encouraging, the evidence for cerebellar involvement in 'non-motor' aspects of predictive language processing remains inconclusive under further scrutiny. Future directions are finally discussed with respect to outstanding questions in this novel field of research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Argyropoulos, Georgios P.

In particular, hyperspectral imaging have been found to reveal physiological and structural characteristics in plants and to allow for tracking physiological dynamics due to environmental effects. In this work, we present an approach to plant phenotyping that integrates non-invasive sensors, computer vision, as well as data mining techniques and allows for monitoring how plants respond to stress. To uncover latent hyperspectral characteristics of diseased plants reliably and in an easy-to-understand way, we ""wordify"" the hyperspectral images, i.e., we turn the images into a corpus of text documents. Then, we apply probabilistic topic models, a well-established natural language processing technique that identifies content and topics of documents. Based on recent regularized topic models, we demonstrate that one can track automatically the development of three foliar diseases of barley. We also present a visualization of the topics that provides plant scientists an intuitive tool for hyperspectral imaging. In short, our analysis and visualization of characteristic topics found during symptom development and disease progress reveal the hyperspectral language of plant diseases."

J	Hage, SR; Nieder, A				Hage, Steffen R.; Nieder, Andreas			Dual Neural Network Model for the Evolution of Speech and Language	TRENDS IN NEUROSCIENCES			English	Review							COMPARATIVE CYTOARCHITECTONIC ANALYSIS; PONTINE BRAIN-STEM; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PERIAQUEDUCTAL GRAY; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; SINGLE NEURONS; FUNCTIONAL SEGREGATION; VOCAL INTERACTION; AKINETIC MUTISM; AUDITORY-CORTEX	Explaining the evolution of speech and language poses one of the biggest challenges in biology. We propose a dual network model that posits a volitional articulatory motor network (VAMN) originating in the prefrontal cortex (PFC; including Broca's area) that cognitively controls vocal output of a phylogenetically conserved primary vocal motor network (PVMN) situated in subcortical structures. By comparing the connections between these two systems in human and nonhuman primate brains, we identify crucial biological preadaptations in monkeys for the emergence of a language system in humans. This model of language evolution explains the exclusiveness of non-verbal communication sounds (e.g., cries) in infants with an immature PFC, as well as the observed emergence of non-linguistic vocalizations in adults after frontal lobe pathologies.

Notable examples of such architectures include gated recurrent units (GRU) and highway networks. In this work, we first focus on the evaluation of each of the classical gated architectures for language modeling for large vocabulary speech recognition. Namely, we evaluate the highway network, lateral network, LSTM and GRU. Furthermore, the motivation underlying the highway network also applies to LSTM and GRU. An extension specific to the LSTM has been recently proposed with an additional highway connection between the memory cells of adjacent LSTM layers. In contrast, we investigate an approach which can be used with both LSTM and GRU: a highway network in which the LSTM or GRU is used as the transformation function. We found that the highway connections enable both standalone feedforward and recurrent neural language models to benefit better from the deep structure and provide a slight improvement of recognition accuracy after interpolation with count models. To complete the overview, we include our initial investigations on the use of the attention mechanism for learning word triggers.

Consequently, users of these software packages are simultaneously forced to use a number of programs for a given study, while also lacking the freedom to explore models that have not been implemented by the developers of those programs. We developed a new open-source software package, RevBayes, to address these problems. RevBayes is entirely based on probabilistic graphical models, a powerful generic framework for specifying and analyzing statistical models. Phylogenetic-graphical models can be speciinot signed interactively in RevBayes, piece by piece, using a new succinct and intuitive language called Rev. Rev is similar to the R language and the BUGS model-speciinot signcation language, and should be easy to learn for most users. The strength of RevBayes is the simplicity with which one can design, specify, and implement new and complex models. Fortunately, this tremendous inot sign,exibility does not come at the cost of slower computation; as we demonstrate, RevBayes outperforms competing software for several standard analyses. Compared with other programs, RevBayes has fewer black-box elements. Users need to explicitly specify each part of the model and analysis. Although this explicitness may initially be unfamiliar, we are convinced that this transparency will improve understanding of phylogenetic models in our inot signeld. Moreover, it will motivate the search for improvements to existing methods by brazenly exposing the model choices that we make to critical scrutiny.

J	Lanvers, U				Lanvers, Ursula			Lots of Selves, some rebellious: Developing the Self Discrepancy Model for Language Learners	SYSTEM			English	Article						Language learning motivation; L2 Motivational Self System; Self discrepancy; Self determination; Other Selves; Rebellious self; Anglophone language learner	FOREIGN-LANGUAGE; L2 MOTIVATION; ENGLISH; PERCEPTIONS; PERSPECTIVE; ATTITUDES; STUDENTS; FRENCH; SYSTEM; IDEAL	This article develops a new language learning motivation model, which is, like the currently dominant model by Dornyei, based on Higgins' (1987) Self Discrepancy Theory. Increasing evidence of 'non-fit' of Dornyei's model, especially (but not solely) from language learners with English as a first language, let to the author revisiting Higgins' original, which had more complex delineation of different Selves that adopted by Dornyei. After critically reviewing the body of literature suggesting 'non-fit' of Dornyei's model, a model with Higgins' original delineations of Selves is proposed and adapted to the language learning context, and then applied on novel data from two different learner groups with English as first language: mature university and adolescent school students. The proposed Self Discrepancy Model for Language Learners contributes to solutions of several problems raised in current discussion of language learner motivation: it provides a better fit of data seemingly incompatible with Dornyei's model, especially a learner type labelled 'rebellious', offers a better embedding of a range of contextual influences on motivation, and facilitates developmental perspectives on language learner motivation. The empirical data delivers on the first two goals, and offers pathways regarding the last. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Zhang, JS; El-Gohary, NM				Zhang, Jiansong; El-Gohary, Nora M.			Extending Building Information Models Semiautomatically Using Semantic Natural Language Processing Techniques	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Automated compliance checking (ACC); Automated information extraction; Building information modeling (BIM); Natural language processing; Semantic systems; Knowledge modeling; Industry foundation classes (IFC) extension; Automated construction management systems	SIMILARITY; PERCEPTRON	Automated compliance checking (ACC) of building designs requires automated extraction of information from building information models (BIMs). However, current industry foundation classes (IFC)-based BIMs provide limited support for ACC, because they lack the necessary information that is needed to perform compliance checking (CC). In this paper, the authors propose a new method for extending the IFC schema to incorporate CC-related information, in an objective and semiautomated manner. The method utilizes semantic natural language processing techniques and machine learning techniques to extract concepts from documents that are related to CC (e. g., building codes) and match the extracted concepts to concepts in the IFC class hierarchy. The proposed method includes a set of methods/algorithms that are combined into one computational platform: (1) a method for concept extraction that utilizes pattern-matching-based rules to extract regulatory concepts from CC-related regulatory documents; (2) a method for concept matching and semantic similarity assessment to select the most related IFC concepts to the extracted regulatory concepts; and (3) a machine learning classification method for predicting the relationship between the extracted regulatory concepts and their most related IFC concepts. The proposed method enables the extension of the IFC schema, in an objective way, using any construction regulatory document. To test and evaluate the proposed method, two chapters were randomly selected from the International Building Code (IBC) 2006 and 2009. Chapter 12 of IBC 2006 was used for training/development and Chapter 19 of IBC 2009 was used for testing and evaluation. Comparing to manually-developed gold standards, 91.7% F1-measure, 84.5% adoption rate, and 87.9% precision were achieved for regulatory concept extraction, IFC concept selection, and relationship classification, respectively.

Cultural adaptation and validation of the Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ): robust nine-dimension Danish language confirmatory factor model	SPRINGERPLUS			English	Article						Health literacy; Questionnaire; Measurement; Validation; Psychometrics; HLQ	PUBLIC-HEALTH; OLDER-PEOPLE; TRANSLATION; EDUCATION; OUTCOMES; PROGRAM; BURDEN	Health literacy is an important construct in population health and healthcare requiring rigorous measurement. The Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ), with nine scales, measures a broad perception of health literacy. This study aimed to adapt the HLQ to the Danish setting, and to examine the factor structure, homogeneity, reliability and discriminant validity. The HLQ was adapted using forward-backward translation, consensus conference and cognitive interviews (n = 15). Psychometric properties were examined based on data collected by face-to-face interview (n = 481). Tests included difficulty level, composite scale reliability and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Cognitive testing revealed that only minor re-wording was required. The easiest scale to respond to positively was 'Social support for health', and the hardest were 'Navigating the healthcare system' and 'Appraisal of health information'. CFA of the individual scales showed acceptably high loadings (range 0.49-0.93). CFA fit statistics after including correlated residuals were good for seven scales, acceptable for one. Composite reliability and Cronbach's a were >0.8 for all but one scale. A nine-factor CFA model was fitted to items with no cross-loadings or correlated residuals allowed. Given this restricted model, the fit was satisfactory. The HLQ appears robust for its intended application of assessing health literacy in a range of settings. Further work is required to demonstrate sensitivity to measure changes.

HLR combines psycholinguistic theory with modern machine learning techniques, indirectly estimating the ""half-life"" of a word or concept in a student's long-term memory. We use data from Duolingo - a popular online language learning application - to fit HLR models, reducing error by 45%+ compared to several baselines at predicting student recall rates. HLR model weights also shed light on which linguistic concepts are systematically challenging for second language learners. Finally, HLR was able to improve Duolingo daily student engagement by 12% in an operational user study."

J	Chien, JT; Ku, YC				Chien, Jen-Tzung; Ku, Yuan-Chu			Bayesian Recurrent Neural Network for Language Modeling	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS			English	Article						Bayesian learning; Hessian matrix; language model; rapid approximation; recurrent neural network	FRAMEWORK	A language model (LM) is calculated as the probability of a word sequence that provides the solution to word prediction for a variety of information systems. A recurrent neural network (RNN) is powerful to learn the large-span dynamics of a word sequence in the continuous space. However, the training of the RNN-LM is an ill-posed problem because of too many parameters from a large dictionary size and a high-dimensional hidden layer. This paper presents a Bayesian approach to regularize the RNN-LM and apply it for continuous speech recognition. We aim to penalize the too complicated RNN-LM by compensating for the uncertainty of the estimated model parameters, which is represented by a Gaussian prior. The objective function in a Bayesian classification network is formed as the regularized cross-entropy error function. The regularized model is constructed not only by calculating the regularized parameters according to the maximum a posteriori criterion but also by estimating the Gaussian hyperparameter by maximizing the marginal likelihood. A rapid approximation to a Hessian matrix is developed to implement the Bayesian RNN-LM (BRNN-LM) by selecting a small set of salient outer-products. The proposed BRNN-LM achieves a sparser model than the RNN-LM. Experiments on different corpora show the robustness of system performance by applying the rapid BRNN-LM under different conditions.

CUED-RNNLM - AN OPEN-SOURCE TOOLKIT FOR EFFICIENT TRAINING AND EVALUATION OF RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK LANGUAGE MODELS	2016 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ACOUSTICS, SPEECH AND SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS	International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing ICASSP		English	Proceedings Paper	41st IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	MAR 20-25, 2016	Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA			language model; recurrent neural network; speech recognition; GPU; open-source toolkit		In recent years, recurrent neural network language models (RNNLMs) have become increasingly popular for a range of applications including speech recognition. However, the training of RNNLMs is computationally expensive, which limits the quantity of data, and size of network, that can be used. In order to fully exploit the power of RNNLMs, efficient training implementations are required. This paper introduces an open-source toolkit, the CUED-RNNLM toolkit, which supports efficient GPU-based training of RNNLMs. RNNLM training with a large number of word level output targets is supported, in contrast to existing tools which used class-based output-targets. Support fot N-best and lattice-based rescoring of both HTK and Kaldi format lattices is included. An example of building and evaluating RNNLMs with this toolkit is presented for a Kaldi based speech recognition system using the AMI corpus. All necessary resources including the source code, documentation and recipe are available online(1).	[Chen, X.; Liu, X.; Ion, Y.; Gales, M. J. F.; Woodland, P.

J	Yang, WW; Tao, JX; Ye, ZF				Yang, Wenwen; Tao, Jinxu; Ye, Zhongfu			Continuous sign language recognition using level building based on fast hidden Markov model	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						Continuous sign language recognition; Level Building; Fast hidden Markov model; Grammar constraint; Sign length constrain		Sign sequence segmentation and sign recognition are two main problems in continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) system. In recent years, dynamic time warping based Level Building (LB-DTW) algorithm has successfully dealt with both two challenges simultaneously. However, there still exists two crucial problems in LB-DTW: low recognition performance due to bad similarity function and offline due to high computation. In this paper, we use hidden Markov model (HMM) to calculate the similarity between the sign model and testing sequence, and a fast algorithm for computing the likelihood of HMM is proposed to reduce the computation complexity. Furthermore, grammar constraint and sign length constraint are employed to improve the recognition rate and a coarse segmentation method is proposed to provide the maximal level number. In experiments with a KINECT dataset of Chinese sign language containing 100 sentences composed of 5 signs each, the proposed method shows superior recognition performance and lower computation compared to other existing techniques.

Similar terms are Smart Factory or Smart Manufacturing. The ideas, concepts and technologies are not hype anymore - they are at least partly reality, but many software specification and development aspects are still not sufficiently covered, e.g. standardization, specification and modeling languages. This paper presents an Industry 4.0 process modeling language (I4PML) that is an extension (UML profile with stereotypes) of OMG's BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) standard. We also describe a method for the specification of Industry 4.0 applications using UML and I4PML.

These rule-based approaches often rely on the highly frequent appearances of certain patterns in a project to infer rules. It is known that if a pattern does not appear frequently enough, rules are not learned, thus missing many bugs. In this paper, we propose a new approach-Bugram-that leverages n-gram language models instead of rules to detect bugs. Bugram models program tokens sequentially, using the n-gram language model. Token sequences from the program are then assessed according to their probability in the learned model, and low probability sequences are marked as potential bugs. The assumption is that low probability token sequences in a program are unusual, which may indicate bugs, bad practices, or unusual/special uses of code of which developers may want to be aware. We evaluate Bugram in two ways. First, we apply Bugram on the latest versions of 16 open source Java projects. Results show that Bugram detects 59 bugs, 42 of which are manually verified as correct, 25 of which are true bugs and 17 are code snippets that should be refactored. Among the 25 true bugs, 23 cannot be detected by PR-Miner. We have reported these bugs to developers, 7 of which have already been confirmed by developers ( 4 of them have already been fixed), while the rest await confirmation. Second, we further compare Bugram with three additional graph-and rule-based bug detection tools, i.e., JADET, Tikanga, and GrouMiner. We apply Bugram on 14 Java projects evaluated in these three studies. Bugram detects 21 true bugs, at least 10 of which cannot be detected by these three tools. Our results suggest that Bugram is complementary to existing rule-based bug detection approaches.

J	Goldberg, Y				Goldberg, Yoav			A Primer on Neural Network Models for Natural Language Processing	JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH			English	Article							DISTRIBUTED REPRESENTATIONS	Over the past few years, neural networks have re-emerged as powerful machine-learning models, yielding state-of-the-art results in fields such as image recognition and speech processing. More recently, neural network models started to be applied also to textual natural language signals, again with very promising results. This tutorial surveys neural network models from the perspective of natural language processing research, in an attempt to bring natural-language researchers up to speed with the neural techniques. The tutorial covers input encoding for natural language tasks, feed-forward networks, convolutional networks, recurrent networks and recursive networks, as well as the computation graph abstraction for automatic gradient computation.

Automatically locating and classifying the relevant action segments in videos of varying lengths proves to be a challenging task. We propose a novel method for temporal action detection including statistical length and language modeling to represent temporal and contextual structure. Our approach aims at globally optimizing the joint probability of three components, a length and language model and a discriminative action model, without making intermediate decisions. The problem of finding the most likely action sequence and the corresponding segment boundaries in an exponentially large search space is addressed by dynamic programming. We provide an extensive evaluation of each model component on Thumos 14, a large action detection dataset, and report state-of-the-art results on three datasets.

J	Challenger, M; Kardas, G; Tekinerdogan, B				Challenger, Moharram; Kardas, Geylani; Tekinerdogan, Bedir			A systematic approach to evaluating domain-specific modeling language environments for multi-agent systems	SOFTWARE QUALITY JOURNAL			English	Article						Domain-specific modeling language (DSML); Evaluation framework; Evaluation of DSMLs; Multi-agent system (MAS); Software agent; SEA_ML	DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT; AGENTS; METAMODEL; IMPLEMENTATION; ARCHITECTURE; DESIGN; DSL	Multi-agent systems (MASs) include multiple interacting agents within an environment to provide a solution for complex systems that cannot be easily solved with individual agents or monolithic systems. However, the development of MASs is not trivial due to the various agent properties such as autonomy, responsiveness, and proactiveness, and the need for realization of the many different agent interactions. To support the development of MASs various domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs) have been introduced that provide a declarative approach for modeling and supporting the generation of agent-based systems. To be effective, the proposed DSMLs need to meet the various stakeholder concerns and the related quality criteria for the corresponding MASs. Unfortunately, very often the evaluation of the DSML is completely missing or has been carried out in idiosyncratic approach. If the DSMLs are not well defined, then implicitly this will have an impact on the quality of the MASs. In this paper, we present an evaluation framework and systematic approach for assessing existing or newly defined DSMLs for MASs. The evaluation is specific for MAS DSMLs and targets both the language and the corresponding tools. To illustrate the evaluation approach, we first present SEA_ML, which is a model-driven MAS DSML for supporting the modeling and generation of agent-based systems. The evaluation of SEA_ML is based on a multi-case study research approach and provides both qualitative evaluation and quantitative analysis. We report on the lessons learned considering the adoption of the evaluation approach as well as the SEA_ML for supporting the generation of agent-based systems.

The models utilize information about single terms in the query and documents as well as term sequences marked as entities by some entity-linking tool. The key principle of the language models is accounting, simultaneously, for the uncertainty inherent in the entity-markup process and the balance between using entity-based and term-based information. Empirical evaluation demonstrates the merits of using the language models for retrieval. For example, the performance transcends that of a state-of-the-art term proximity method. We also show that the language models can be effectively used for cluster-based document retrieval and query expansion.

J	Garagnani, M; Pulvermuller, F				Garagnani, Max; Pulvermueller, Friedemann			Conceptual grounding of language in action and perception: a neurocomputational model of the emergence of category specificity and semantic hubs	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cell assembly; cortical connectivity; functional differentiation; Hebbian learning; word meaning	LONG-TERM DEPRESSION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; BRAIN MECHANISMS; AUDITORY-CORTEX; FRONTAL-LOBE; NEURAL BASIS; MOTOR AREAS; REPRESENTATIONS; ORGANIZATION; CONNECTIONS	Current neurobiological accounts of language and cognition offer diverging views on the questions of where' and how' semantic information is stored and processed in the human brain. Neuroimaging data showing consistent activation of different multi-modal areas during word and sentence comprehension suggest that all meanings are processed indistinctively, by a set of general semantic centres or hubs'. However, words belonging to specific semantic categories selectively activate modality-preferential areas; for example, action-related words spark activity in dorsal motor cortex, whereas object-related ones activate ventral visual areas. The evidence for category-specific and category-general semantic areas begs for a unifying explanation, able to integrate the emergence of both. Here, a neurobiological model offering such an explanation is described. Using a neural architecture replicating anatomical and neurophysiological features of frontal, occipital and temporal cortices, basic aspects of word learning and semantic grounding in action and perception were simulated. As the network underwent training, distributed lexico-semantic circuits spontaneously emerged. These circuits exhibited different cortical distributions that reached into dorsal-motor or ventral-visual areas, reflecting the correlated category-specific sensorimotor patterns that co-occurred during action- or object-related semantic grounding, respectively. Crucially, substantial numbers of neurons of both types of distributed circuits emerged in areas interfacing between modality-preferential regions, i.e. in multimodal connection hubs, which therefore became loci of general semantic binding. By relating neuroanatomical structure and cellular-level learning mechanisms with system-level cognitive function, this model offers a neurobiological account of category-general and category-specific semantic areas based on the different cortical distributions of the underlying semantic circuits.

Equation-based languages - A new paradigm for building energy modeling, simulation and optimization	ENERGY AND BUILDINGS			English	Article						Equation-based modeling; Modelica; Multi-physics simulation; Smart grid; Optimal control		Most of the state-of-the-art building simulation programs implement models in imperative programming languages. This complicates modeling and excludes the use of certain efficient methods for simulation and optimization. In contrast, equation-based modeling languages declare relations among variables, thereby allowing the use of computer algebra to enable much simpler schematic modeling and to generate efficient code for simulation and optimization. We contrast the two approaches in this paper. We explain how such manipulations support new use cases. In the first of two examples, we couple models of the electrical grid, multiple buildings, HVAC systems and controllers to test a controller that adjusts building room temperatures and PV inverter reactive power to maintain power quality. In the second example, we contrast the computing time for solving an optimal control problem for a room-level model predictive controller with and without symbolic manipulations. Exploiting the equation-based language led to 2200 times faster solution. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The central thesis of this article is that the major historical framing model, the Classic ""Wernicke-Lichtheim-Geschwind"" model, and associated terminology, is no longer adequate for contemporary investigations into the neurobiology of language. We argue that the Classic model (1) is based on an outdated brain anatomy; (2) does not adequately represent the distributed connectivity relevant for language, (3) offers a modular and ""language centric"" perspective, and (4) focuses on cortical structures, for the most part leaving out subcortical regions and relevant connections. To make our case, we discuss the issue of anatomical specificity with a focus on the contemporary usage of the terms ""Broca's and Wernicke's area"", including results of a survey that was conducted within the language neurobiology community. We demonstrate that there is no consistent anatomical definition of ""Broca's and Wernicke's Areas"", and propose to replace these terms with more precise anatomical definitions. We illustrate the distributed nature of the language connectome, which extends far beyond the single-pathway notion of arcuate fasciculus connectivity established in Geschwind's version of the Classic Model. By illustrating the definitional confusion surrounding ""Broca's and Wernicke's areas"", and by illustrating the difficulty integrating the emerging literature on perisylvian white matter connectivity into this model, we hope to expose the limits of the model, argue for its obsolescence, and suggest a path forward in defining a replacement.

Domain modeling is an important step in the transition from natural-language requirements to precise specifications. For large systems, building a domain model manually is a laborious task. Several approaches exist to assist engineers with this task, whereby candidate domain model elements are automatically extracted using Natural Language Processing (NLP). Despite the existing work on domain model extraction, important facets remain under-explored: (1) there is limited empirical evidence about the usefulness of existing extraction rules (heuristics) when applied in industrial settings; (2) existing extraction rules do not adequately exploit the natural-language dependencies detected by modern NLP technologies; and (3) an important class of rules developed by the information retrieval community for information extraction remains unutilized for building domain models. Motivated by addressing the above limitations, we develop a domain model extractor by bringing together existing extraction rules in the software engineering literature, extending these rules with complementary rules from the information retrieval literature, and proposing new rules to better exploit results obtained from modern NLP dependency parsers. We apply our model extractor to four industrial requirements documents, reporting on the frequency of different extraction rules being applied. We conduct an expert study over one of these documents, investigating the accuracy and overall effectiveness of our domain model extractor.

In this paper, we explore the problem of automatically generating question answer pairs from a given knowledge graph. The generated question answer (QA) pairs can be used in several downstream applications. For example, they could be used for training better QA systems. To generate such QA pairs, we first extract a set of keywords from entities and relationships expressed in a triple stored in the knowledge graph. From each such set, we use a subset of keywords to generate a natural language question that has a unique answer. We treat this subset of keywords as a sequence and propose a sequence to sequence model using RNN to generate a natural language question from it. Our RNN based model generates QA pairs with an accuracy of 33.61 percent and performs 110.47 percent (relative) better than a state-of-the-art template based method for generating natural language question from keywords. We also do an extrinsic evaluation by using the generated QA pairs to train a QA system and observe that the F1-score of the QA system improves by 5.5 percent (relative) when using automatically generated QA pairs in addition to manually generated QA pairs available for training.

One of the major factor behind these successes is the availability of high quality parallel corpora. We explore two strategies on leveraging abundant amount of monolingual data for neural machine translation. We observe improvements by both combining scores from neural language model trained only on target monolingual data with neural machine translation model and fusing hidden-states of these two models. We obtain up to 2 BLEU improvement over hierarchical and phrase-based baseline on low-resource language pair, Turkish -> English. Our method was initially motivated towards tasks with less parallel data, but we also show that it extends to high resource languages such as Cs -> En and De -> En translation tasks, where we obtain 0.39 and 0.47 BLEU improvements over the neural machine translation baselines, respectively.

Despite the large numbers enrolled in online language courses, very little is known about students' motivation and strategy use in these learning environments, or how they may affect their online learning outcomes. This study helps fill this gap by examining students' motivation and learning-strategy use across a number of online language courses, and investigating the role of motivation and such strategies within the framework of self-regulated learning. Based on data about online language-learning strategies collected from 466 high-school level online language students in a Midwestern virtual school, our findings indicated that online learning strategies operated at a moderate level in the process of foreign language-learning. Further analysis using structural equation modeling revealed that the use of online learning strategies predicted students' online learning outcomes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, when new spoken dialog applications are built from scratch in real user environments that often have sub-optimal audio characteristics, ASR performance can suffer due to factors such as the paucity of training data or a mismatch between the training and test data. To address this issue, this paper proposes an ASR-free, end-to-end (E2E) modeling approach to SLU for a cloud-based, modular spoken dialog system (SDS). We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on crowdsourced data collected from non-native English speakers interacting with a conversational language learning application. Experimental results show that our approach is particularly promising in situations with low ASR accuracy. It can further improve the performance of a sophisticated CNN-based SLU system with more accurate ASR hypotheses by fusing the scores from E2E system, i.e., the overall accuracy of SLU is improved from 85.6% to 86.5%.

Although back-off N-gram LMs (BLMs) have been used dominantly for decades, they suffer from the data sparseness problem, especially for high-order LMs. Recently, neural network LMs (NNLMs) have been applied to handwriting recognition with superiority to BLMs. With the aim of improving Chinese handwriting recognition, this paper evaluates the effects of two types of character-level NNLMs, namely, feedforward neural network LMs (FNNLMs) and recurrent neural network LMs (RNNLMs). Both FNNLMs and RNNLMs are also combined with BLMs to construct hybrid LMs. For fair comparison with BLMs and a state-of-the-art system, we evaluate in a system with the same character over-segmentation and classification techniques as before, and compare various LMs using a small text corpus used before. Experimental results on the Chinese handwriting database CASIA-HWDB validate that NNLMs improve the recognition performance, and hybrid RNNLMs outperform the other LMs. To report a new benchmark, we also evaluate selected LMs on a large corpus, and replace the baseline character classifier, over-segmentation, and geometric context models with convolutional neural network (CNN) based models. The performance on both the CASIA-HWDB and the ICDAR-2013 competition dataset are improved significantly. On the CASIA-HWDB test set, the character-level accurate rate (AR) and correct rate (CR) achieve 95.88% and 95.95%, respectively.

Measuring Language Mindsets and Modeling Their Relations With Goal Orientations and Emotional and Behavioral Responses in Failure Situations	MODERN LANGUAGE JOURNAL			English	Article						language mindsets; implicit theories; language beliefs; achievement goals; goal orientations; perceived language competence	IMPLICIT THEORIES; ACADEMIC-ACHIEVEMENT; BELIEFS; MOTIVATION; 2ND-LANGUAGE; ATTRIBUTIONS; COMMUNICATE; ANXIETY; ENTITY	Some people ascribe successful language learning to an innate aptitude that cannot be further developed, at least after a certain young age (i.e., an entity mindset), while other people believe that language learning ability can be improved (i.e., an incremental mindset). The purpose of this research is to (a) introduce the Language Mindsets Inventory (LMI), and (b) test the mindsets-goals-responses model, which maintains that learners' mindsets predict the goals that they set for language learning, and that these goals in turn affect how they respond to difficult academic and communication episodes. Correlational and factor analyses provided evidence of the LMI's valid and reliable use in research with university-level language students. Path analyses showed that regardless of their competence level, greater endorsement of an incremental mindset was associated with the goal of learning more about the language, and this learning goal in turn predicted greater mastery and less helpless responses in failure situations. Greater endorsement of an entity mindset predicted the goal of demonstrating competence (i.e., performance approach goals) when students believed that they had stronger language skills. The use of the LMI in future research and the importance of supporting incremental mindsets for language education are discussed.

A key variable accounting for much variance in lexical processing is frequency, but the size of the frequency effect has been demonstrated to reduce as a consequence of the individual's vocabulary size. Using a connectionist computational implementation of the triangle model on a large set of English words, where orthographic, phonological, and semantic representations interact during processing, we show that the model demonstrates a reduced frequency effect as a consequence of amount of exposure to the language, a variable that was also a cause of greater vocabulary size in the model. The model was also trained to learn a second language, Dutch, and replicated behavioural observations that increased proficiency in a second language resulted in reduced frequency effects for that language but increased frequency effects in the first language. The model provides a first step to demonstrating causal relations between psycholinguistic variables in a model of individual differences in lexical processing, and the effect of bilingualism on interacting variables within the language processing system.

J	Peltokorpi, V; Yamao, S				Peltokorpi, Vesa; Yamao, Sachiko			Corporate language proficiency in reverse knowledge transfer: A moderated mediation model of shared vision and communication frequency	JOURNAL OF WORLD BUSINESS			English	Article						Communication frequency; Corporate language proficiency; Host country national; Reverse knowledge transfer; Shared vision	SUBSIDIARY ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; MULTINATIONAL-CORPORATIONS; SOCIAL IDENTITY; ORGANIZATIONAL CAPABILITY; EMPIRICAL-EXAMINATION; FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES; SELF-CATEGORIZATION; FLOWS; BENEFITS; IDENTIFICATION	In this paper, we developed and tested a moderated mediation model of interunit relational characteristics in reverse knowledge transfer. Specifically, by integrating international business research with social identity theory, we hypothesized that shared vision mediates the positive effect between host country national employees' corporate language proficiency and reverse knowledge transfer. Furthermore, we hypothesized that headquarters-subsidiary communication frequency enhances the relationships between language proficiency and shared vision as well as shared vision and reverse knowledge transfer. We tested these effects on data collected from 574 middle managers leading functional departments of foreign subsidiaries in Japan. Our findings supported these hypotheses. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

MALWARE CLASSIFICATION WITH LSTM AND GRU LANGUAGE MODELS AND A CHARACTER-LEVEL CNN	2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ACOUSTICS, SPEECH AND SIGNAL PROCESSING (ICASSP)	International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing ICASSP		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	MAR 05-09, 2017	New Orleans, LA			Malware Classification; Neural Language Model; LSTM; GRU; CNN		Malicious software, or malware, continues to be a problem for computer users, corporations, and governments. Previous research [1] has explored training file-based, malware classifiers using a two-stage approach. In the first stage, a malware language model is used to learn the feature representation which is then input to a second stage mal ware classifier. In Pascanu et al. [1], the language model is either a standard recurrent neural network (RNN) or an echo state network (ESN). In this work, we propose several new mal ware classification architectures which include a long short-term memory (LSTM) language model and a gated recurrent unit (GRU) language model. We also propose using an attention mechanism similar to [12] from the machine translation literature, in addition to temporal max pooling used in [1], as an alternative way to construct the file representation from neural features. Finally, we propose a new single-stage malware classifier based on a character-level convolutional neural network (CNN). Results show that the LSTM with temporal max pooling and logistic regression offers a 31.3% improvement in the true positive rate compared to the best system in [1] at a false positive rate of 1 %.

In this contribution, we analyse an attention-based seq2seq speech recognition system that directly transcribes recordings into characters. We observe two shortcomings: overconfidence in its predictions and a tendency to produce incomplete transcriptions when language models are used. We propose practical solutions to both problems achieving competitive speaker independent word error rates on the Wall Street Journal dataset: without separate language models we reach 10.6% WER, while together with a trigram language model, we reach 6.7% WER. a state-of-the-art result for HMM-free methods.

There has been a lot of research in this direction but the problem of integrating state-of-the-art neural language models with affective information remains an area ripe for exploration. In this paper, we propose an extension to an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) language model for generating conversational text, conditioned on affect categories. Our proposed model, Affect-LM enables us to customize the degree of emotional content in generated sentences through an additional design parameter. Perception studies conducted using Amazon Mechanical Turk show that Affect-LM generates naturally looking emotional sentences without sacrificing grammatical correctness.

However, in most cases, the recurrent network that operates on word-level representations to produce context sensitive representations is trained on relatively little labeled data. In this paper, we demonstrate a general semi-supervised approach for adding pre-trained context embeddings from bidirectional language models to NLP systems and apply it to sequence labeling tasks. We evaluate our model on two standard datasets for named entity recognition (NER) and chunking, and in both cases achieve state of the art results, surpassing previous systems that use other forms of transfer or joint learning with additional labeled data and task specific gazetteers.

J	Yousfi, S; Berrani, SA; Garcia, C				Yousfi, Sonia; Berrani, Sid-Ahmed; Garcia, Christophe			Contribution of recurrent connectionist language models in improving LSTM-based Arabic text recognition in videos	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Connectionist language model; Arabic video OCR; Decoding; RNN; LSTM; Convolutional Neural Network		Unconstrained text recognition in videos is a very challenging task that begins to draw the attention of the OCR community. However, for Arabic video contents, this problem is much less addressed compared at least with Latin script. This work presents our latest contribution to this task, introducing recurrent connectionist language modeling in order to improve Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) based Arabic text recognition in videos. For a LSTM OCR system that basically yields high recognition rates, introducing proper language models can easily deteriorate results. In this work, we focus on two main factors to reach better improvements. First, we propose to use Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for language modeling that are able to capture long range linguistic dependencies. We use simple RNN models and models that are learned jointly with a Maximum Entropy language model. Second, for the decoding schema, we are not limited to a n-best restoring of the OCR hypotheses. Instead, we propose a modified beam search algorithm that uses both OCR and language model probabilities in parallel at each decoding time-step. We introduce a set of hyper-parameters to the algorithm in order to boost recognition results and to control the decoding time. The method is used for Arabic text recognition in TV Broadcast. We conduct an extensive evaluation of the method and study the impact of the language models and the decoding parameters. Results show an improvement of 16% in terms of word recognition rate (WRR) over the baseline that uses only the OCR responses, while keeping a reasonable response time. Moreover, the proposed recurrent connectionist models outperform frequency-based models by more than 4% in terms of WRR. The final recognition schema provides outstanding results that outperform well-known commercial OCR engine by more than 36% in terms of WRR.

We address the following research questions: Do both languages contribute to crosslinguistic influence in third language acquisition, or is one of them chosen as the sole source of influence? Is crosslinguistic influence always from the typologically more similar language? Is crosslinguistic influence always facilitative, or can it also be non-facilitative? Methodology: The paper reports on a grammaticality judgment task with two word order conditions, both related to verb movement (verb-second in Norwegian and subject-auxiliary inversion in English). Data and Analysis: An experiment was carried out with three groups of 11-14-year-old participants, Norwegian-Russian bilinguals (n=22), Norwegian-speaking monolinguals (n=46), and Russian-speaking monolinguals (n=31). The data were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed effects logistic regression allowing us to estimate the effects of condition (Adv-V, Aux-S), language (Norwegian, Norwegian-Russian, Russian) and their interaction on the correctness of judgments. Findings: The analysis reveals that while L1 Norwegian children over-accept ungrammatical sentences in English with a word order that reflects verb movement (V2), bilingual Norwegian-Russian children notice these errors significantly more often, just like L1 Russians. At the same time, the bilinguals score lower than L1 Russian children on grammatical trials, suggesting the presence of non-facilitative influence from Norwegian. Originality: This study argues for the Linguistic Proximity Model, which proposes incremental property-by-property learning and allows for both facilitative and non-facilitative influence from one or both of the previously acquired languages. Significance: The Linguistic Proximity Model and supporting experimental data contribute to existing models in third language acquisition by indicating that not just typological proximity but also structural similarity at an abstract level should be considered an important factor in third language acquisition.

In this study, we sought to investigate the link between engagement and motivation over the course of a semester in a naturally occurring Japanese elementary school classroom environment. Four-hundred and twenty-three fifth-year students in public elementary schools in western Japan agreed to participate in the research. Students completed surveys at two time points, first at the beginning of the semester regarding their in-class,engagement, and again at the end of the semester regarding their motivation. A structural equation model was constructed using engagement and gender as predictors and motivational regulations as outcome variables. Observer rating of each class was used to triangulate. Engagement strongly predicted more adaptive intrinsically regulated motives and negatively predicted more extrinsic motives. Male students showed a tendency toward lower engagement, lower internally regulated motives, and higher externally regulated motives. Observer rating showed that students' reported engagement was visible to outside observers. Findings indicate that students' in-class engagement may be an important variable when investigating the long-term dynamics of foreign language learning in a classroom setting. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Oga-Baldwin, W. L.

J	Slabakova, R				Slabakova, Roumyana			The scalpel model of third language acquisition	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BILINGUALISM			English	Article						L3; Ln acquisition; multilingualism; morphosyntactic development; crosslinguistic influence; facilitative transfer	L3 INITIAL-STATE; TYPOLOGICAL PRIMACY MODEL; 2ND-LANGUAGE ACQUISITION; SYNTACTIC TRANSFER; 3RD-LANGUAGE-ACQUISITION; MONOLINGUALS; BILINGUALS; FEATURES	Aims and Objectives: This article proposes the scalpel model, a new model of third and additional language (L3/Ln) acquisition. The model aims to identify and examine what happens beyond the initial state of acquisition and what factors may influence change from one state of knowledge to another. Methodology: The article briefly examines the currently proposed hypotheses and models and evaluates the existing evidence for their predictions. It highlights several cognitive and experiential factors affecting crosslinguistic influence that are not taken into account by the current models. These factors include: structural linguistic complexity; misleading input or lack of clear unambiguous evidence for some properties or constructions; construction frequency in the target L3; and prevalent language activation or use. Data and analysis: Findings of recently published research are discussed in support of the scalpel model. In particular, findings of differential learnability of properties within the same groups of learners suggest that L1 or L2 transfer happens property by property and is influenced by diverse factors. Findings: The scalpel model explicitly argues that wholesale transfer of one of the previously acquired languages does not happen at the initial stages of acquisition because it is not necessary. It also argues that transfer can be from the L1 or the L2 or both, but it is not only facilitative. Originality: The new model increases the explanatory coverage of the current experimental findings on how the L3/Ln linguistic representations develop. Implications: The model emphasizes the importance of the cognitive, experiential, and linguistic influences on the L3/Ln beyond transfer from the L1 or L2. Thus, it aligns L3/Ln acquisition with current debates within L2 acquisition theory.

We address the issue of accelerating the material discovery with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. The method involves two different types of prediction; the forward and backward predictions. The objective of the forward prediction is to create a set of machine learning models on various properties of a given molecule. Inverting the trained forward models through Bayes' law, we derive a posterior distribution for the backward prediction, which is conditioned by a desired property requirement. Exploring high-probability regions of the posterior with a sequential Monte Carlo technique, molecules that exhibit the desired properties can computationally be created. One major difficulty in the computational creation of molecules is the exclusion of the occurrence of chemically unfavorable structures. To circumvent this issue, we derive a chemical language model that acquires commonly occurring patterns of chemical fragments through natural language processing of ASCII strings of existing compounds, which follow the SMILES chemical language notation. In the backward prediction, the trained language model is used to refine chemical strings such that the properties of the resulting structures fall within the desired property region while chemically unfavorable structures are successfully removed. The present method is demonstrated through the design of small organic molecules with the property requirements on HOMO-LUMO gap and internal energy. The R package iqspr is available at the CRAN repository.

We use a multi-layer recurrent highway network to model the temporal nature of spoken speech, and show that it learns to extract both form and meaning-based linguistic knowledge from the input signal. We carry out an in-depth analysis of the representations used by different components of the trained model and show that encoding of semantic aspects tends to become richer as we go up the hierarchy of layers, whereas encoding of form-related aspects of the language input tends to initially increase and then plateau or decrease.

JuMP takes advantage of advanced features of the Julia programming language to offer unique functionality while achieving performance on par with commercial modeling tools for standard tasks. In this work we will provide benchmarks, present the novel aspects of the implementation, and discuss how JuMP can be extended to new problem classes and composed with state-of-the-art tools for visualization and interactivity.

A Neurocomputational Model of the N400 and the P600 in Language Processing	COGNITIVE SCIENCE			English	Article						Language comprehension; Event-related potentials; N400; P600; Retrieval-Integration account; Computational modeling; Neural networks	SENTENCE COMPREHENSION; CORTICAL ORGANIZATION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; BRAIN; POTENTIALS; RESPONSES; DORSAL; SEMANTICS; NETWORKS; CORTEX	Ten years ago, researchers using event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to study language comprehension were puzzled by what looked like a Semantic Illusion: Semantically anomalous, but structurally well-formed sentences did not affect the N400 componenttraditionally taken to reflect semantic integrationbut instead produced a P600 effect, which is generally linked to syntactic processing. This finding led to a considerable amount of debate, and a number of complex processing models have been proposed as an explanation. What these models have in common is that they postulate two or more separate processing streams, in order to reconcile the Semantic Illusion and other semantically induced P600 effects with the traditional interpretations of the N400 and the P600. Recently, however, these multi-stream models have been called into question, and a simpler single-stream model has been proposed. According to this alternative model, the N400 component reflects the retrieval of word meaning from semantic memory, and the P600 component indexes the integration of this meaning into the unfolding utterance interpretation. In the present paper, we provide support for this Retrieval-Integration (RI) account by instantiating it as a neurocomputational model. This neurocomputational model is the first to successfully simulate the N400 and P600 amplitude in language comprehension, and simulations with this model provide a proof of concept of the single-stream RI account of semantically induced patterns of N400 and P600 modulations.

Motivating young language learners: A longitudinal model of self determined motivation in elementary school foreign language classes	CONTEMPORARY EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						SDT; Longitudinal model; Engagement; Motivational development; Elementary school; Japan	INTEGRATIVE ORIENTATIONS; LEARNING DEMOTIVATION; PSYCHOLOGICAL NEEDS; STUDENTS; ENGAGEMENT; AUTONOMY; CLASSROOM; JAPANESE; EXPERIENCES; EDUCATION	Promoting intrinsic motivation is often a central concern in teaching foreign languages to elementary school children. Self-determination theory posits that intrinsic motivation develops through the interaction of the person and the environment. The present study investigated how elementary school students' motivation develops over the course of a school year in Japanese public schools. Five-hundred and fifteen Japanese elementary school children were surveyed over the course of one school year. Self-reported motivation, perceptions of teacher support, need satisfaction, and engagement were measured at different times. External raters observed students' engagement, while classroom teachers assessed the quality of students' motivation and learning. Structural equation modeling results indicated a positive, dynamic relationship between motivation, perceptions of the learning environment, and engagement. External raters' assessments showed significant positive correlations with students' self-reported engagement. Findings indicate how the instruction offered in these Japanese elementary schools supported students' foreign language learning motivation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Their success on this task is often linked to their ability to capture unbounded context. In this paper we develop a finite context approach through stacked convolutions, which can be more efficient since they allow parallelization over sequential tokens. We propose a novel simplified gating mechanism that outperforms Oord et al. (2016b) and investigate the impact of key architectural decisions. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art on the WikiText-103 benchmark, even though it features longterm dependencies, as well as competitive results on the Google Billion Words benchmark. Our model reduces the latency to score a sentence by an order of magnitude compared to a recurrent baseline. To our knowledge, this is the first time a non-recurrent approach is competitive with strong recurrent models on these large scale language tasks.

Novel approaches de-emphasize this concept and view the problem as a sequence classification problem. In this context, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have achieved significant success. The idea is to use RNNs as discriminative binary classifiers to predict a positive or negative sentiment label at every word position then perform a type of pooling to get a sentence-level polarity. Here, we investigate a novel generative approach in which a separate probability distribution is estimated for every sentiment using language models (LMs) based on long short-term memory (LSTM) RNNs. We introduce a novel type of LM using a modified version of bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM) called contextual BLSTM (cBLSTM), where the probability of a word is estimated based on its full left and right contexts. Our approach is compared with a BLSTM binary classifier. Significant improvements are observed in classifying the IMDB movie review dataset. Further improvements are achieved via model combination.

However, textual data is essential for natural language processing, and particularly important for training language models to support speech recognition. Even in cases where text data is missing, there are some languages for which bilingual lexicons are available, since creating lexicons is a fundamental task of documentary linguistics. We investigate the use of such lexicons to improve language models when textual training data is limited to as few as a thousand sentences. The method involves learning cross-lingual word embeddings as a preliminary step in training monolingual language models. Results across a number of languages show that language models are improved by this pre-training. Application to Yongning Na, a threatened language, highlights challenges in deploying the approach in real low-resource environments.

This is mainly due to the relative recency of research efforts in developing natural language processing (NLP) methods for Arabic, handling its morphological complexity, and the lack of large-scale opinion resources for Arabic. To close this gap, we examine the class of models used for English and that do not require extensive use of NLP or opinion resources. In particular, we consider the Recursive Auto Encoder (RAE). However, RAE models are not as successful in Arabic as they are in English, due to their limitations in handling the morphological complexity of Arabic, providing a more complete and comprehensive input features for the auto encoder, and performing semantic composition following the natural way constituents are combined to express the overall meaning. In this article, we propose A Recursive Deep Learning Model for Opinion Mining in Arabic (AROMA) that addresses these limitations. AROMA was evaluated on three Arabic corpora representing different genres and writing styles. Results show that AROMA achieved significant performance improvements compared to the baseline RAE. It also outperformed several well-known approaches in the literature.

J	Vias-Guasch, N; Wu, YJ				Vias-Guasch, Nestor; Wu, Yan Jing			The role of the putamen in language: a meta-analytic connectivity modeling study	BRAIN STRUCTURE & FUNCTION			English	Article						Putamen; Language; Meta-analytic connectivity modeling; Coactivation	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; BASAL GANGLIA; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; RIGHT-HEMISPHERE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EPISODIC MEMORY; WORKING-MEMORY; FRONTAL GYRUS	The putamen is a subcortical structure that forms part of the dorsal striatum of basal ganglia, and has traditionally been associated with reinforcement learning and motor control, including speech articulation. However, recent studies have shown involvement of the left putamen in other language functions such as bilingual language processing (Abutalebi et al. 2012) and production, with some authors arguing for functional segregation of anterior and posterior putamen (Oberhuber et al. 2013). A further step in exploring the role of putamen in language would involve identifying the network of coactivations of not only the left, but also the right putamen, given the involvement of right hemisphere in high order language functions (Vigneau et al. 2011). Here, a meta-analytic connectivity modeling technique was used to determine the patterns of coactivation of anterior and bilateral putamen in the language domain. Based on previous evidence, we hypothesized that left putamen coactivations would include brain regions directly associated with language processing, whereas right putamen coactivations would encompass regions involved in broader semantic processes, such as memory and visual imagery. The results showed that left anterior putamen coactivated with clusters predominantly in left hemisphere, encompassing regions directly associated with language processing, a left posterior putamen network spanning both hemispheres, and cerebellum. In right hemisphere, coactivations were in both hemispheres, in regions associated with visual and orthographic processing. These results confirm the differential involvement of right and left putamen in different language components, thus highlighting the need for further research into the role of putamen in language.

Therefore in this paper we propose a formal data model for JSON documents and, based on the common features present in available systems using JSON, we define a lightweight query language allowing us to navigate through JSON documents. We also introduce a logic capturing the schema proposal for JSON and study the complexity of basic computational tasks associated with these two formalisms.

In this paper, we present a training method that can incrementally train the hierarchical softmax function for NNMLs. We split the cost function to model old and update corpora separately, and factorize the objective function for the hierarchical softmax. Then we provide a new stochastic gradient based method to update all the word vectors and parameters, by comparing the old tree generated based on the old corpus and the new tree generated based on the combined (old and update) corpus. Theoretical analysis shows that the mean square error of the parameter vectors can be bounded by a function of the number of changed words related to the parameter node. Experimental results show that incremental training can save a lot of time. The smaller the update corpus is, the faster the update training process is, where an up to 30 times speedup has been achieved. We also use both word similarity/relatedness tasks and dependency parsing task as our benchmarks to evaluate the correctness of the updated word vectors.

Focus groups (N = 44) conducted with second language (L2) practitioners and teacher educators and a cluster analysis of questionnaire data with a larger sample (N = 293) of K-12 language teachers were used to identify and corroborate typical archetypes across the spectrum of language teacher immunity outcomes. Serial in-depth interviews were then conducted with representative respondents from each archetype (N = 18) to trace developmental trajectories and investigate how these profiles manifested phenomenologically in teachers' motivated thought and instructional practices. Results indicate that teacher immunity is associated with practitioners' psychological, emotional, and cognitive functioning in the social setting of the L2 classroom. These findings contribute to the field's understanding of how language teachers sustain their adaptivity, openness to change, psychological well-being, and their sense of purpose and investment in students' learning. Thus, teacher immunity has the potential to bridge individual and situative concerns in second language teacher education and the psychology of language teaching and learning.

However, the use of phonetic information has been largely overlooked by most existing neural LID methods, although this information has been used very successfully in conventional phonetic LID systems. We present a phonetic temporal neural model for LID, which is an LSTM-RNN LID system that accepts phonetic features produced by a phone-discriminative DNN as the input, rather than raw acoustic features. This new model is similar to traditional phonetic LID methods, but the phonetic knowledge here is much richer: It is at the frame level and involves compacted information of all phones. Our experiments conducted on the Babel database and the AP16-OLR database demonstrate that the temporal phonetic neural approach is very effective, and significantly outperforms existing acoustic neural models. It also outperforms the conventional i-vector approach on short utterances and in noisy conditions.

In our prior work, we have proposed a multi-level LM, in which character-based and word-based RNN-LMs are combined in hybrid CTC/attention-based ASR. Although this multi-level approach achieves significant error reduction in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) task, two different LMs need to be trained and used for decoding, which increase the computational cost and memory usage. In this paper, we further propose a novel word-based RNN-LM, which allows us to decode with only the word-based LM, where it provides look-ahead word probabilities to predict next characters instead of the character-based LM, leading competitive accuracy with less computation compared to the multi-level LM. We demonstrate the efficacy of the word-based RNN-LMs using a larger corpus, LibriSpeech, in addition to WSJ we used in the prior work. Furthermore, we show that the proposed model achieves 5.1 % WER for WSJ Eval'92 test set when the vocabulary size is increased, which is the best WER reported for end-to-end ASR systems on this benchmark.

Adams			Validation of Prediction Models for Critical Care Outcomes Using Natural Language Processing of Electronic Health Record Data	JAMA NETWORK OPEN			English	Article							UNIT RISK ADJUSTMENT; INTENSIVE-CARE; TEXT CLASSIFICATION; HOSPITAL MORTALITY; VETERANS-AFFAIRS; ACUTE PHYSIOLOGY; PART 2; SEVERITY; SELECTION; ACCURACY	IMPORTANCE Accurate prediction of outcomes among patients in intensive care units (ICUs) is important for clinical research and monitoring care quality. Most existing prediction models do not take full advantage of the electronic health record, using only the single worst value of laboratory tests and vital signs and largely ignoring information present in free-text notes. Whether capturing more of the available data and applying machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) can improve and automate the prediction of outcomes among patients in the ICU remains unknown. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the change in power for a mortality prediction model among patients in the ICU achieved by incorporating measures of clinical trajectory together with NLP of clinical text and to assess the generalizability of this approach. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cohort study included 101 196 patients with a first-time admission to the ICU and a length of stay of at least 4 hours. Twenty ICUs at 2 academic medical centers (University of California, San Francisco [UCSF], and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center [BIDMC], Boston, Massachusetts) and 1 community hospital (Mills-Peninsula Medical Center [MPMC], Burlingame, California) contributed data from January 1, 2001, through June 1, 2017. Data were analyzed from July 1, 2017, through August 1, 2018. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES In-hospital mortality and model discrimination as assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and model calibration as assessed by the modified Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic. RESULTS Among 101 196 patients included in the analysis, 51.3%(n = 51 899) were male, with a mean (SD) age of 61.3 (17.1) years; their in-hospital mortality rate was 10.4%(n = 10 505). A baseline model using only the highest and lowest observed values for each laboratory test result or vital sign achieved a cross-validated AUC of 0.831 (95% CI, 0.830-0.832). In contrast, that model augmented with measures of clinical trajectory achieved an AUC of 0.899 (95% CI, 0.896-0.902; P < .001 for AUC difference). Further augmenting this model with NLP-derived terms associated with mortality further increased the AUC to 0.922 (95% CI, 0.916-0.924; P < .001). These NLP-derived terms were associated with improved model performance even when applied across sites (AUC difference for UCSF: 0.077 to 0.021; AUC difference for MPMC: 0.071 to 0.051; AUC difference for BIDMC: 0.035 to 0.043; P < .001) when augmenting with NLP at each site. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Intensive care unit mortality prediction models incorporating measures of clinical trajectory and NLP-derived terms yielded excellent predictive performance and generalized well in this sample of hospitals. The role of these automated algorithms, particularly those using unstructured data from notes and other sources, in clinical research and quality improvement seems to merit additional investigation.

Materials and Methods: In this study, 96,303 head computed tomography (CT) reports were obtained. The linguistic complexity of these reports was compared with that of alternative corpora. Head CT reports were preprocessed, and machine-analyzable features were constructed by using bag-of-words (BOW), word embedding, and Latent Dirichlet allocation-based approaches. Ultimately, 1004 head CT reports were manually labeled for findings of interest by physicians, and a subset of these were deemed critical findings. Lasso logistic regression was used to train models for physician-assigned labels on 602 of 1004 head CT reports (60%) using the constructed features, and the performance of these models was validated on a held-out 402 of 1004 reports (40%). Models were scored by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and aggregate AUC statistics were reported for (a) all labels, (b) critical labels, and (c) the presence of any critical finding in a report. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and F1 score were reported for the best performing model's (a) predictions of all labels and (b) identification of reports containing critical findings. Results: The best-performing model (BOW with unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams plus average word embeddings vector) had a held-out AUC of 0.966 for identifying the presence of any critical head CT finding and an average 0.957 AUC across all head CT findings. Sensitivity and specificity for identifying the presence of any critical finding were 92.59% (175 of 189) and 89.67% (191 of 213), respectively. Average sensitivity and specificity across all findings were 90.25% (1898 of 2103) and 91.72% (18 351 of 20 007), respectively. Simpler BOW methods achieved results competitive with those of more sophisticated approaches, with an average AUC for presence of any critical finding of 0.951 for unigram BOW versus 0.966 for the best-performing model. The Yule I of the head CT corpus was 34, markedly lower than that of the Reuters corpus (at 103) or I2B2 discharge summaries (at 271), indicating lower linguistic complexity. Conclusion: Automated methods can be used to identify findings in radiology reports. The success of this approach benefits from the standardized language of these reports. With this method, a large labeled corpus can be generated for applications such as deep learning.

We propose Universal Language Model Fine-tuning (ULMFiT), an effective transfer learning method that can be applied to any task in NLP, and introduce techniques that are key for fine-tuning a language model. Our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on six text classification tasks, reducing the error by 18-24% on the majority of datasets. Furthermore, with only 100 labeled examples, it matches the performance of training from scratch on 100x more data. We opensource our pretrained models and code(1).

Joint learning has shown to be effective in SLU given that slot tags and intents are supposed to share knowledge with each other. However, most existing joint learning methods only consider joint learning by sharing parameters on surface level rather than semantic level. In this work, we propose a novel self-attentive model with gate mechanism to fully utilize the semantic correlation between slot and intent. Our model first obtains intent-augmented embeddings based on neural network with self-attention mechanism. And then the intent semantic representation is utilized as the gate for labelling slot tags. The objectives of both tasks are optimized simultaneously via joint learning in an end-to-end way. We conduct experiment on popular benchmark ATIS. The results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art and outperforms other popular methods by a large margin in terms of both intent detection error rate and slot filling F1-score. This paper gives a new perspective for research on SLU.

The Second Language Writer Self-Efficacy Scale was developed and evaluated through a series of rigorous validation procedures. The researchers collected data from 609 university students in China. Confirmatory factory analyses through structural equation modeling validated the proposed three-dimensional structure of writing self-efficacy, including linguistic self-efficacy, self-regulatory efficacy, and performance self-efficacy. Model comparisons confirmed the hypothesis that writing self-efficacy is a multidimensional construct, in which the three factors are conceptually related. Internal and composite reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity were examined, suggesting satisfactory psychometric properties of the scale. The concurrent validity and predictive validity were checked by examining correlations of writing self-efficacy with motivational beliefs and writing performance. Findings revealed that the three dimensions of self-efficacy had small to moderate correlations with writing performance. Significant correlations were also found between writing self-efficacy and motivational beliefs (e.g., task value, intrinsic goal orientation, extrinsic goal orientation). The findings support a social cognitive view of self-efficacy that acknowledges the interplay of behaviors, personal factors, and environmental conditions. Theoretical and pedagogical implications are discussed.

The approach benefits by performing model training without using lexicon and alignments. However, this poses a new problem of requiring more data compared to conventional DNN-HMM systems. In this work, we attempt to use data from 10 BABEL languages to build a multilingual seq2seq model as a prior model, and then port them towards 4 other BABEL languages using transfer learning approach. We also explore different architectures for improving the prior multilingual seq2seq model. The paper also discusses the effect of integrating a recurrent neural network language model (RNNLM) with a seq2seq model during decoding. Experimental results show that the transfer learning approach from the multilingual model shows substantial gains over monolingual models across all 4 BABEL languages. Incorporating an RNNLM also brings significant improvements in terms of %WER, and achieves recognition performance comparable to the models trained with twice more training data.

This approach folds the acoustic model, pronunciation model, and language model into a single network and requires only a parallel corpus of speech and text for training. However, unlike in conventional approaches that combine separate acoustic and language models, it is not clear how to use additional (unpaired) text. While there has been previous work on methods addressing this problem, a thorough comparison among methods is still lacking. In this paper, we compare a suite of past methods and some of our own proposed methods for using unpaired text data to improve encoder-decoder models. For evaluation, we use the medium-sized Switchboard data set and the large-scale Google voice search and dictation data sets. Our results confirm the benefits of using unpaired text across a range of methods and data sets. Surprisingly, for first-pass decoding, the rather simple approach of shallow fusion performs best across data sets. However, for Google data sets we find that cold fusion has a lower oracle error rate and outperforms other approaches after second-pass rescoring on the Google voice search data set.

Spam problems and its influence on the society have been investigated and discussed from different perspectives. Several studies have looked into the influence of the spam on the economy, financial, marketing, business and management, while others deliberate the impact of the spam on the security and privacy. Subsequently, there are different anti-spam techniques that have spam filtering or blocking mechanisms. This work attempts to investigate an available anti-spam technology and highlight the possible improvements. Consequently, it constructs a new agent-based anti-spam model that can overcome some existing limitations. The Multi-Natural Language Anti-Spam (MNLAS) model comprises visual information, and texts of an email in the spam filtering process. The MNLAS is implemented in a Java environment using Jade agent platform. The application detects and filters spam emails of different types using a dataset of 200 emails.

Thus, on the basis of independent research on the memory systems, the model can generate specific and often novel predictions for language. Till now most such predictions and ensuing empirical work have been motivated by research on the neurocognition of the two memory systems. However, there is also a large literature on techniques that enhance learning and memory. The DP model provides a theoretical framework for predicting which techniques should extend to language learning, and in what circumstances they should apply. In order to lay the neurocognitive groundwork for these predictions, here we first summarize the neurocognitive fundamentals of the two memory systems and briefly lay out the resulting claims of the DP model for both first and second language. We then provide an overview of learning and memory enhancement techniques before focusing on two techniques - spaced repetition and retrieval practice - that have been linked to the memory systems. Next, we present specific predictions for how these techniques should enhance language learning, and review existing evidence, which suggests that they do indeed improve the learning of both first and second language.

Two questionnaires, Online Language Learning Motivation (OLLM) and Online Self-regulated English Learning (OSEL), were developed and administered to 293 Chinese university students. The results indicated that OLLM consists of five factors, namely online language learning experience, cultural interest, instrumentality-promotion, instrumentality-prevention, and others' expectations. Meanwhile, OSEL is composed of six factors: goal setting, time management, environment structuring, help seeking, task strategies, and self-evaluation. The path analysis revealed that students with a positive future image of their language learning and an intrinsic interest in English culture tended to have better self-regulatory capacity in online learning environments. In contrast, students who learn English so as to avoid negative academic results might be less motivated to carry out online self-regulated learning. Also worthy of note is the negative association between L2 learners' previous online learning experience and their online self-regulatory efforts. Learners with positive online learning experiences tended to be more flexible and independent in their self-regulatory learning process. Related pedagogical implications are discussed, such as motivating learners to visualize a successful future self, improving their inherent interest in learning English, and designing more effective online tasks.

Natural language instructions typically identify only a few high-level decisions and landmarks rather than complete low-level motor behaviors; much of the missing information must be inferred based on perceptual context. In machine learning settings, this is doubly challenging: it is difficult to collect enough annotated data to enable learning of this reasoning process from scratch, and also difficult to implement the reasoning process using generic sequence models. Here we describe an approach to vision-and-language navigation that addresses both these issues with an embedded speaker model. We use this speaker model to (1) synthesize new instructions for data augmentation and to (2) implement pragmatic reasoning, which evaluates how well candidate action sequences explain an instruction. Both steps are supported by a panoramic action space that reflects the granularity of human-generated instructions. Experiments show that all three components of this approach-speaker-driven data augmentation, pragmatic reasoning and panoramic action space-dramatically improve the performance of a baseline instruction follower, more than doubling the success rate over the best existing approach on a standard benchmark.

However, model-free DRL models do not consider the dynamics in the real-world environments, and they often fail to generalize to new scenes. In this paper, we take a radical approach to bridge the gap between synthetic studies and real-world practices-We propose a novel, planned-ahead hybrid reinforcement learning model that combines model-free and model-based reinforcement learning to solve a real-world vision-language navigation task. Our look-ahead module tightly integrates a look-ahead policy model with an environment model that predicts the next state and the reward. Experimental results suggest that our proposed method significantly outperforms the baselines and achieves the best on the real-world Room-toRoom dataset.

Cloud modeling languages (CMLs) have been proposed to address the diversity of features provided by cloud computing environments and support different application scenarios, such as migrating existing applications to the cloud, developing new cloud applications, or optimizing them. There is, however, still much debate in the research community on what a CML is, and what aspects of a cloud application and its target cloud computing environment should be modeled by a CML. Furthermore, the distinction between CMLs on a fine-grain level exposing their modeling concepts is rarely made. In this article, we investigate the diverse features currently provided by existing CMLs. We classify and compare them according to a common framework with the goal to support CSCs in selecting the CML that fits the needs of their application scenario and setting. As a result, not only features of existing CMLs are pointed out for which extensive support is already provided but also in which existing CMLs are deficient, thereby suggesting a research agenda.

Modeling second language writing quality: A structural equation investigation of lexical, syntactic, and cohesive features in source-based and independent writing	ASSESSING WRITING			English	Article						Second language writing; Structural equation modeling; Lexical sophistication; Syntactic complexity; Cohesion; Writing quality	COMPLEXITY-MEASURES; PROFICIENCY; SOPHISTICATION; INDEXES; INVARIANCE; JUDGMENTS	This study develops a model of second language (L2) writing quality in the context of a standardized writing test (TOEFL iBT) using a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach. A corpus of 480 test-takers' responses to source-based and independent writing tasks was the basis for the model. Four latent variables were constructed: an L2 writing quality variable informed by scores of source-based and independent writing tasks, and lexical sophistication, syntactic complexity, and cohesion variables informed by lexical, syntactic, and cohesive features within the essays. The SEM analysis showed that an L2 writing quality model had a good fit, and was generalizable across writing prompts (with the exception of lexical features), gender, and learning contexts. The structural regression analysis indicated that 81.7% of the variance in L2 writing quality was explained by lexical decision reaction time scores (beta = 0.932), lexical overlap between paragraphs (beta = 0.434), and mean length of clauses via lexical decision reaction time scores (beta = 0.607). These findings indicate that higher-rated essays tend to contain more sophisticated words that elicited longer response times in lexical decision tasks, greater lexical overlap between paragraphs, and longer clauses accompanying more sophisticated words. Implications for evaluating lexical, syntactic, and cohesive features in L2 writing are discussed.

J	Teng, LS; Zhang, LJ				Teng, Lin Sophie; Zhang, Lawrence Jun			Effects of motivational regulation strategies on writing performance: a mediation model of self-regulated learning of writing in English as a second/foreign language	METACOGNITION AND LEARNING			English	Article						Motivational regulation strategies; Self-regulated learning (SRL); Writing performance; Mediation models	INSTRUCTION; CHINESE	Motivational regulation has long been recognized as an essential but insufficiently investigated aspect of self-regulated learning (SRL), especially in relation to learning English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL) writing. This study intends to fill the gap by investigating the predictive effect of motivational regulation strategies on EFL students' writing performance mediated by SRL strategies. Data were collected from undergraduate students in mainland China (N = 512) through self-report questionnaires and an English writing test. Results of structural equation modeling (SEM) confirmed a partial mediation model in which motivational regulation strategies, as a whole, not only had direct and indirect effects on students' writing performance but were also significantly correlated with their reported use of SRL strategies relating to cognition, metacognition, and social behavior. In addition, only cognitive and metacognitive strategies were found to be significant mediators in the model while social behavior strategies were not. The findings suggest that cumulative knowledge of motivational regulation is an antecedent of the reported use of other SRL strategies in affecting EFL writing performance. The inclusion of SRL strategies in the mediation model also contributes to a clear understanding of L2 writing processes within the SRL mechanism for improving writing outcomes.

With the goal of enhancing our understanding of language models, this study investigated the diffusion characteristics of candidate tracts in aphasic patients. We evaluated 14 subacute aphasic patients post-stroke and 11 healthy controls with language assessment and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping found multiple linguistic associations for the ventral stream, while automated fiber quantification (AFQ) showed, via reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) and axial diffusivity with increased radial diffusivity (all corrected p < 0.05), that the integrity of both the left dorsal and ventral streams was compromised. The average diffusion metrics of each fascicle provided by AFQ also confirmed that voxels with significant FA-language correlations were located in the ventral tracts, including the left inferior fronto-occipital fascicle (IFOF) (comprehension: r = 0.839, p = 0.001; repetition: r = 0.845, p = 0.001; naming: r = 0.813, p = 0.002; aphasia quotient: r = 0.847, p = 0.001) and uncinate fascicle (naming: r = 0.948, p = 0.001). Furthermore, point-wise AFQ revealed that the segment of the left IFOF with the strongest correlations was its narrow stem. The temporal segment of the left inferior longitudinal fascicle was also found to correlate significantly with comprehension (r = 0.663, p = 0.03) and repetition (r = 0.742, p = 0.009). This preliminary study suggests that white matter integrity analysis of the ventral stream may have the potential to reveal aphasic severity and guide individualized rehabilitation.

With the availability of large annotated data, it has recently become feasible to train complex models such as neural-network-based inference models, which have shown to achieve the state-of-the-art performance. Although there exist relatively large annotated data, can machines learn all knowledge needed to perform natural language inference (NLI) from these data? If not, how can neural-network-based NLI models benefit from external knowledge and how to build NLI models to leverage it? In this paper, we enrich the state-of-the-art neural natural language inference models with external knowledge. We demonstrate that the proposed models improve neural NLI models to achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the SNLI and MultiNLI datasets.

In this paper, we investigate the role of context in an LSTM LM, through ablation studies. Specifically, we analyze the increase in perplexity when prior context words are shuffled, replaced, or dropped. On two standard datasets, Penn Treebank and WikiText-2, we find that the model is capable of using about 200 tokens of context on average, but sharply distinguishes nearby context (recent 50 tokens) from the distant history. The model is highly sensitive to the order of words within the most recent sentence, but ignores word order in the long-range context (beyond 50 tokens), suggesting the distant past is modeled only as a rough semantic field or topic. We further find that the neural caching model (Grave et al., 2017b) especially helps the LSTM to copy words from within this distant context. Overall, our analysis not only provides a better understanding of how neural LMs use their context, but also sheds light on recent success from cache-based models.

Thus, the language model component is only trained on transcribed audio-text pairs. This leads to the use of shallow fusion with an external language model at inference time. Shallow fusion refers to log-linear interpolation with a separately trained language model at each step of the beam search. In this work, we investigate the behavior of shallow fusion across a range of conditions: different types of language models, different decoding units, and different tasks. On Google Voice Search, we demonstrate that the use of shallow fusion with an neural LM with wordpieces yields a 9.1% relative word error rate reduction (WERR) over our competitive attention-based sequence-to-sequence model, obviating the need for second-pass rescoring.

Recent advances in neural networks (NNs) make it possible to build reliable models without handcrafted features. However, in many cases, it is hard to obtain sufficient annotations to train these models. In this study, we develop a neural framework to extract knowledge from raw texts and empower the sequence labeling task. Besides word-level knowledge contained in pre trained word embeddings, character-aware neural language models are incorporated to extract character-level knowledge. Transfer learning techniques are further adopted to mediate different components and guide the language model towards the key knowledge. Comparing to previous methods, these task-specific knowledge allows us to adopt a more concise model and conduct more efficient training. Different from most transfer learning methods, the proposed framework does not rely on any additional supervision. It extracts knowledge from self-contained order information of training sequences. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging character-level knowledge and the efficiency of co-training. For example, on the CoNLL03 NER task, model training completes in about 6 hours on a single GPU, reaching F-1 score of 91.71+/-0.10 without using any extra annotations.

Performance has further been improved by leveraging unlabeled data, often in the form of a language model. In this work, we present the Cold Fusion method, which leverages a pre-trained language model during training, and show its effectiveness on the speech recognition task. We show that Seq2Seq models with Cold Fusion are able to better utilize language information enjoying i) faster convergence and better generalization, and ii) almost complete transfer to a new domain while using less than 10% of the labeled training data.

We present a computational technique for creation of grammatically valid artificial CM data based on the Equivalence Constraint Theory. We show that when training examples are sampled appropriately from this synthetic data and presented in certain order (aka training curriculum) along with monolingual and real CM data, it can significantly reduce the perplexity of an RNN-based language model. We also show that randomly generated CM data does not help in decreasing the perplexity of the LMs.	[Pratapa, Adithya; Bhat, Gayatri; Choudhury, Monojit; Sitaram, Sunayana; Bali, Kalika] Microsoft Res, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Bhat, Gayatri] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Language Technol Inst, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Dandapat, Sandipan] Microsoft R&D, Hyderabad, India	Microsoft; Carnegie Mellon University	Pratapa, A (corresponding author), Microsoft Res, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.	t-pradi@microsoft.com; gbhat@andrew.cmu.edu; monojitc@microsoft.com; sunayana.sitaram@microsoft.com; sadandap@microsoft.com; kalikab@microsoft.com						Adel H, 2014, INTERSPEECH, P1415; Adel H, 2014, INTERSPEECH, P651; Adel Heike, 2013, P 51 ANN M ASS COMP, V2, P206; [Anonymous], 1995, ONE SPEAKER 2 LANGUA; [Anonymous], 1998, BILINGUALISM LANGUAG; [Anonymous], 2012, 13 ANN C INT SPEECH; [Anonymous], 1993, SOCIAL MOTIVATIONS C; Arisoy E., 2012, P NAACL HLT 2012 WOR, P20; Baheti Ashutosh, 2017, P ICON, P65; Barman Utsab, 2014, 1 WORKSH COMP APPR C; BELAZI HM, 1994, LINGUIST INQ, V25, P221; Bengio Y, 2003, J MACH LEARN RES, V3, P1137, DOI 10.1162/153244303322533223; Che T., 2017, ARXIV170207983; DISCIULLO AM, 1986, J LINGUIST, V22, P1, DOI 10.1017/S0022226700010537; Dyer Chris, 2013, PROC NAACL; Gamback Bjorn, 2016, P 10 INT C LANG RES; Gamback<spacing B., 2014, P 1 WORKSH LANG TECH; Gebhardt Jan, 2011, SPEECH RECOGNITION E; He Y, 2010, P 23 INT C COMP LING, P374; Joshi A., 1985, NATURAL LANGUAGE PAR, P190, DOI [DOI 10.1017/CBO9780511597855.006, 10.1017/CBO9780511597855.006, DOI 10.1017/CBO9780511597855]; KLEIN D.

Different from these methods, we propose an attention-based architecture(1) which is completely based on CNNs. The distinctive characteristics of our method include: (1) the method follows encoder-decoder architecture, in which the encoder is a two-dimensional residual CNN and the decoder is a deep one-dimensional CNN. (2) An attention module that captures visual cues, and a language module that models linguistic rules are designed equally in the decoder. Therefore the attention and language can be viewed as an ensemble to boost predictions jointly. (3) Instead of using a single loss from language aspect, multiple losses from attention and language are accumulated for training the networks in an end-to-end way. We conduct experiments on standard datasets for scene text recognition, including Street View Text, IIIT5K and ICDAR datasets. The experimental results show our CNN-based method has achieved state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets, even without the use of RNN.

We automatically construct a large number of minimally different pairs of English sentences, each consisting of a grammatical and an ungrammatical sentence. The sentence pairs represent different variations of structure-sensitive phenomena: subject-verb agreement, reflexive anaphora and negative polarity items. We expect a language model to assign a higher probability to the grammatical sentence than the ungrammatical one. In an experiment using this data set, an LSTM language model performed poorly on many of the constructions. Multi-task training with a syntactic objective (CCG supertagging) improved the LSTM's accuracy, but a large gap remained between its performance and the accuracy of human participants recruited online. This suggests that there is considerable room for improvement over LSTMs in capturing syntax in a language model.

We focus on the Transformers for our analysis as they have been shown effective on various tasks, including machine translation (MT), standard left-to-right language models (LM) and masked language modeling (MLM). Previous work used black-box probing tasks to show that the representations learned by the Transformer differ significantly depending on the objective. In this work, we use canonical correlation analysis and mutual information estimators to study how information flows across Transformer layers and how this process depends on the choice of learning objective. For example, as you go from bottom to top layers, information about the past in left-to-right language models gets vanished and predictions about the future get formed. In contrast, for MLM, representations initially acquire information about the context around the token, partially forgetting the token identity and producing a more generalized token representation. The token identity then gets recreated at the top MLM layers.

Current relation extraction methods try to alleviate the noise by multi-instance learning and by providing supporting linguistic and contextual information to more efficiently guide the relation classification. While achieving state-of-the-art results, we observed these models to be biased towards recognizing a limited set of relations with high precision, while ignoring those in the long tail. To address this gap, we utilize a pre-trained language model, the OpenAI Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) (Radford et al., 2018). The GPT and similar models have been shown to capture semantic and syntactic features, and also a notable amount of ""common-sense"" knowledge, which we hypothesize are important features for recognizing a more diverse set of relations. By extending the GPT to the distantly supervised setting, and fine-tuning it on the NYT10 dataset, we show that it predicts a larger set of distinct relation types with high confidence. Manual and automated evaluation of our model shows that it achieves a state-of-the-art AUC score of 0.422 on the NYT10 dataset, and performs especially well at higher recall levels."

J	Chen, HN; Luo, XW				Chen, Hainan; Luo, Xiaowei			An automatic literature knowledge graph and reasoning network modeling framework based on ontology and natural language processing	ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS			English	Article						Representation ontology; Natural language processing; Knowledge graph; Knowledge reasoning	CONSTRUCTION SAFETY; MANAGEMENT; CLASSIFICATION; SOFTWARE; CITATION; SYSTEM	With the advancement of scientific and engineering research, a huge number of academic literature are accumulated. Manually reviewing the existing literature is the main way to explore embedded knowledge, and the process is quite time-consuming and labor intensive. As the quantity of literature is increasing exponentially, it would be more difficult to cover all aspects of the literature using the traditional manual review approach. To overcome this drawback, bibliometric analysis is used to analyze the current situation and trend of a specific research field. In the bibliometric analysis, only a few key phrases (e.g., authors, publishers, journals, and citations) are usually used as the inputs for analysis. Information other than those phrases is not extracted for analysis, while that neglected information (e.g., abstract) might provide more detailed knowledge in the article. To tackle with this problem, this study proposed an automatic literature knowledge graph and reasoning network modeling framework based on ontology and Natural Language Processing (NLP), to facilitate the efficient knowledge exploration from literature abstract. In this framework, a representation ontology is proposed to characterize the literature abstract data into four knowledge elements (background, objectives, solutions, and findings), and NLP technology is used to extract the ontology instances from the abstract automatically. Based on the representation ontology, a four-space integrated knowledge graph is built using NLP technology. Then, reasoning network is generated according to the reasoning mechanism defined in the proposed ontology model. To validate the proposed framework, a case study is conducted to analyze the literature in the field of construction management. The case study proves that the proposed ontology model can be used to represent the knowledge embedded in the literatures' abstracts, and the ontology elements can be automatically extracted by NLP models. The proposed framework can be an enhancement for the bibliometric analysis to explore more knowledge from the literature.

In this work, we propose a generic approach called Human Importance-aware Network Tuning (HINT) that effectively leverages human demonstrations to improve visual grounding. HINT encourages deep networks to be sensitive to the same input regions as humans. Our approach optimizes the alignment between human attention maps and gradient-based network importances - ensuring that models learn not just to look at but rather rely on visual concepts that humans found relevant for a task when making predictions. We apply HINT to Visual Question Answering and Image Captioning tasks, outperforming top approaches on splits that penalize over-reliance on language priors (VQA-CP and robust captioning) using human attention demonstrations for just 6% of the training data.

In order to accelerate the discovery of PPIs for different species, many computational methods have been developed. Unfortunately, even though computational methods are constantly evolving, efficient methods for predicting PPIs from protein sequence information have not been found for many years due to limiting factors including both methodology and technology. Inspired by the similarity of biological sequences and languages, developing a biological language processing technology may provide a brand new theoretical perspective and feasible method for the study of biological sequences. In this paper, a pure biological language processing model is proposed for predicting protein-protein interactions only using a protein sequence. The model was constructed based on a feature representation method for biological sequences called bio-to-vector (Bio2Vec) and a convolution neural network (CNN). The Bio2Vec obtains protein sequence features by using a ""bio-word"" segmentation system and a word representation model used for learning the distributed representation for each ""bio-word"". The Bio2Vec supplies a frame that allows researchers to consider the context information and implicit semantic information of a bio sequence. A remarkable improvement in PPIs prediction performance has been observed by using the proposed model compared with state-of-the-art methods. The presentation of this approach marks the start of ""bio language processing technology,"" which could cause a technological revolution and could be applied to improve the quality of predictions in other problems."

Whereas most existing approaches learn low-level representations, we propose a joint visual-linguistic model to learn high-level features without any explicit supervision. In particular, inspired by its recent success in language modeling, we build upon the BERT model to learn bidirectional joint distributions over sequences of visual and linguistic tokens, derived from vector quantization of video data and off-the-shelf speech recognition outputs, respectively. We use VideoBERT in numerous tasks, including action classification and video captioning. We show that it can be applied directly to open-vocabulary classification, and confirm that large amounts of training data and cross-modal information are critical to performance. Furthermore, we outperform the state-of-the-art on video captioning, and quantitative results verify that the model learns high-level semantic features.

In this work, we extend this approach to multiple languages and show the effectiveness of cross-lingual pretraining. We propose two methods to learn cross-lingual language models (XLMs): one unsupervised that only relies on monolingual data, and one supervised that leverages parallel data with a new cross-lingual language model objective. We obtain state-of-the-art results on cross-lingual classification, unsupervised and supervised machine translation. On XNLI, our approach pushes the state of the art by an absolute gain of 4.9% accuracy. On unsupervised machine translation, we obtain 34.3 BLEU on WMT'16 German-English, improving the previous state of the art by more than 9 BLEU. On supervised machine translation, we obtain a new state of the art of 38.5 BLEU on WMT'16 Romanian-English, outperforming the previous best approach by more than 4 BLEU.

Whilst learning linguistic knowledge, these models may also be storing relational knowledge present in the training data, and may be able to answer queries structured as ""fillin-the-blank"" cloze statements. Language models have many advantages over structured knowledge bases: they require no schema engineering, allow practitioners to query about an open class of relations, are easy to extend to more data, and require no human supervision to train. We present an in-depth analysis of the relational knowledge already present (without fine-tuning) in a wide range of state-of-theart pretrained language models. We find that (i) without fine-tuning, BERT contains relational knowledge competitive with traditional NLP methods that have some access to oracle knowledge, (ii) BERT also does remarkably well on open-domain question answering against a supervised baseline, and (iii) certain types of factual knowledge are learned much more readily than others by standard language model pretraining approaches. The surprisingly strong ability of these models to recall factual knowledge without any fine-tuning demonstrates their potential as unsupervised open-domain QA systems.

Achieving high accuracy with these end-to-end models without a large amount of training data is difficult. We propose a method to reduce the data requirements of end-to-end SLU in which the model is first pre-trained to predict words and phonemes, thus learning good features for SLU. We introduce a new SLU dataset, Fluent Speech Commands, and show that our method improves performance both when the full dataset is used for training and when only a small subset is used. We also describe preliminary experiments to gauge the model's ability to generalize to new phrases not heard during training.

The advantage of this architecture is that it has a fast iteration speed in the training stage because there is no sequential operation as with recurrent neural networks (RNN). However, an RNN is still the best option for end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks in terms of overall training speed (i.e., convergence) and word error rate (WER) because of effective joint training and decoding methods. To realize a faster and more accurate ASR system, we combine Transformer and the advances in RNN-based ASR. In our experiments, we found that the training of Transformer is slower than that of RNN as regards the learning curve and integration with the naive language model (LM) is difficult. To address these problems, we integrate connectionist temporal classification (CTC) with Transformer for joint training and decoding. This approach makes training faster than with RNNs and assists LM integration. Our proposed ASR system realizes significant improvements in various ASR tasks. For example, it reduced the WERs from 11.1% to 4.5% on the Wall Street Journal and from 16.1% to 11.6% on the TED-LIUM by introducing CTC and LM integration into the Transformer baseline.

These models are typically trained using truncated backpropagation through time, and it is common to assume that their success stems from their ability to remember long-term contexts. In this paper, we show that a deep (64-layer) transformer model (Vaswani et al. 2017) with fixed context outperforms RNN variants by a large margin, achieving state of the art on two popular benchmarks: 1.13 bits per character on text8 and 1.06 on enwik8. To get good results at this depth, we show that it is important to add auxiliary losses, both at intermediate network layers and intermediate sequence positions.

Applied to a Recurrent Neural Network Transducer (RNN-T) ASR model trained on a given domain, a matched in-domain RNN-LM, and a target domain RNN-LM, the proposed method uses Bayes' Rule to define RNN-T posteriors for the target domain, in a manner directly analogous to the classic hybrid model for ASR based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) or LSTMs in the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) framework (Bourlard & Morgan, 1994). The proposed approach is evaluated in cross-domain and limited-data scenarios, for which a significant amount of target domain text data is used for LM training, but only limited (or no) faudio, transcriptg training data pairs are used to train the RNN-T. Specifically, an RNN-T model trained on paired audio & transcript data from YouTube is evaluated for its ability to generalize to Voice Search data.

Previous research suggests that processing moral dilemmas in a foreign language influences utilitarian and deontological response tendencies. However, because the two kinds of moral inclinations were confounded with general action tendencies, it remains unclear whether language effects on moral judgments reflect genuine differences in peoples sensitivity to consequences and norms, or broader differences in general action tendencies regardless of consequences and norms. Using the CNI model of moral decision-making, the current research (N = 634) demonstrates that foreign language reduces sensitivity to consequences and sensitivity to norms without affecting general action tendencies. Implications for moral choices in international contexts and language effects on decision-making are discussed.

Identifying and Reducing Gender Bias in Word-Level Language Models	NAACL HLT 2019: THE 2019 CONFERENCE OF THE NORTH AMERICAN CHAPTER OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS: HUMAN LANGUAGE TECHNOLOGIES: PROCEEDINGS OF THE STUDENT RESEARCH WORKSHOP			English	Proceedings Paper	Conference of the North-American-Chapter of the Association-for-Computational-Linguistics - Human Language Technologies (NAACL-HLT)	JUN 02-07, 2019	Minneapolis, MN					Many text corpora exhibit socially problematic biases, which can be propagated or amplified in the models trained on such data. For example, doctor cooccurs more frequently with male pronouns than female pronouns. In this study we (i) propose a metric to measure gender bias; (ii) measure bias in a text corpus and the text generated from a recurrent neural network language model trained on the text corpus; (iii) propose a regularization loss term for the language model that minimizes the projection of encoder-trained embeddings onto an embedding subspace that encodes gender; (iv) finally, evaluate efficacy of our proposed method on reducing gender bias. We find this regularization method to be effective in reducing gender bias up to an optimal weight assigned to the loss term, beyond which the model becomes unstable as the perplexity increases. We replicate this study on three training corpora-Penn Treebank, WikiText-2, and CNN/Daily Mail-resulting in similar conclusions.

By contrast, it has been considerably more difficult to relate these components to neurobiologically grounded accounts of language. Here, we propose a theoretical framework based on a predictive coding architecture, within which negative language-related ERP components such as the N400 can be accounted for in a neurobiologically plausible manner. Specifically, we posit that the amplitude of negative language-related ERP components reflects precision-weighted prediction error signals, i.e., prediction errors weighted by the relevance of the information source leading to the error. From this perspective, precision has a direct link to cue validity in a particular language and, thereby, to relevance of individual linguistic features for internal model updating. We view components such as the N400 and LAN as members of a family with similar functional characteristics and suggest that latency and topography differences between these components reflect the locus of prediction errors and model updating within a hierarchically organized cortical predictive coding architecture. This account has the potential to unify findings from the full range of the N400 literature, including word-level, sentence-, and discourse-level results as well as cross-linguistic differences.

An Investigation of Annotator Bias in Natural Language Understanding Datasets	2019 CONFERENCE ON EMPIRICAL METHODS IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING AND THE 9TH INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019): PROCEEDINGS OF THE CONFERENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing / 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP)	NOV 03-07, 2019	Hong Kong, HONG KONG					Crowdsourcing has been the prevalent paradigm for creating natural language understanding datasets in recent years. A common crowdsourcing practice is to recruit a small number of high-quality workers, and have them massively generate examples. Having only a few workers generate the majority of examples raises concerns about data diversity, especially when workers freely generate sentences. In this paper, we perform a series of experiments showing these concerns are evident in three recent NLP datasets. We show that model performance improves when training with annotator identifiers as features, and that models are able to recognize the most productive annotators. Moreover, we show that often models do not generalize well to examples from annotators that did not contribute to the training set. Our findings suggest that annotator bias should be monitored during dataset creation, and that test set annotators should be disjoint from training set annotators.

A Modified LSTM Model for Continuous Sign Language Recognition Using Leap Motion	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL			English	Article						Sign language recognition; depth sensors; deep neural networks; leap motion sensor	SENSOR; FRAMEWORK	Sign language facilitates communication between hearing impaired peoples and the rest of the society. A number of sign language recognition (SLR) systems have been developed by researchers, but they are limited to isolated sign gestures only. In this paper, we propose a modified long short-term memory (LSTM) model for continuous sequences of gestures or continuous SLR that recognizes a sequence of connected gestures. It is based on splitting of continuous signs into sub-units and modeling them with neural networks. Thus, the consideration of a different combination of sub-units is not required during training. The proposed system has been tested with 942 signed sentences of Indian Sign Language (ISL). These sign sentences are recognized using 35 different sign words. The average accuracy of 72.3% and 89.5% has been recorded on signed sentences and isolated sign words, respectively.

The model is pre-trained using three types of language modeling tasks: unidirectional, bidirectional, and sequence-to-sequence prediction. The unified modeling is achieved by employing a shared Transformer network and utilizing specific self-attention masks to control what context the prediction conditions on. UNILM compares favorably with BERT on the GLUE benchmark, and the SQuAD 2.0 and CoQA question answering tasks.

Processing biomedical and clinical text is a critically important application area of natural language processing, for which there are few robust, practical, publicly available models. This paper describes scispaCy, a new Python library and models for practical biomedical/scientific text processing, which heavily leverages the spaCy library. We detail the performance of two packages of models released in scispaCy and demonstrate their robustness on several tasks and datasets.

Centralized machine learning techniques require the collection of massive user data for training purposes, which may raise privacy concerns in relation to users' sensitive data. Federated learning (FL) provides a promising approach to learning private language modeling for intelligent personalized keyboard suggestions by training models on distributed clients rather than training them on a central server. To obtain a global model for prediction, existing FL algorithms simply average the client models and ignore the importance of each client during model aggregation. Furthermore, there is no optimization for learning a well-generalized global model on the central server. To solve these problems, we propose a novel model aggregation with an attention mechanism considering the contribution of client models to the global model, together with an optimization technique during server aggregation. Our proposed attentive aggregation method minimizes the weighted distance between the server model and client models by iteratively updating parameters while attending to the distance between the server model and client models. Experiments on two popular language modeling datasets and a social media dataset show that our proposed method outperforms its counterparts in terms of perplexity and communication cost in most settings of comparison.

Traditional techniques relied on heuristics and templates built manually by human experts. Recently, data-driven approaches based on neural machine translation have largely overtaken template-based systems. But nearly all of these techniques rely almost entirely on programs having good internal documentation; without clear identifier names, the models fail to create good summaries. In this paper, we present a neural model that combines words from code with code structure from an AST. Unlike previous approaches, our model processes each data source as a separate input, which allows the model to learn code structure independent of the text in code. This process helps our approach provide coherent summaries in many cases even when zero internal documentation is provided. We evaluate our technique with a dataset we created from 2.1m Java methods. We find improvement over two baseline techniques from SE literature and one from NLP literature.

In this paper, we analyze the structure of attention in a Transformer language model, the GPT-2 small pretrained model. We visualize attention for individual instances and analyze the interaction between attention and syntax over a large corpus. We find that attention targets different parts of speech at different layer depths within the model, and that attention aligns with dependency relations most strongly in the middle layers. We also find that the deepest layers of the model capture the most distant relationships. Finally, we extract exemplar sentences that reveal highly specific patterns targeted by particular attention heads.

Language Learning as Language Use: A Cross-Linguistic Model of Child Language Development	PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIEW			English	Article						language acquisition; corpora; chunking; shallow parsing; usage-based approach	GOOD-ENOUGH REPRESENTATIONS; GRAMMATICAL GENDER; RELATIVE CLAUSES; COMPUTATIONAL MODEL; CONNECTIONIST MODEL; FORMULAIC LANGUAGE; ARGUMENT STRUCTURE; BUILDING-BLOCKS; THEMATIC ROLES; WORD-ORDER	"While usage-based approaches to language development enjoy considerable support from computational studies, there have been few attempts to answer a key computational challenge posed by usage-based theory: the successful modeling of language learning as language use. We present a usage-based computational model of language acquisition which learns in a purely incremental fashion, through online processing based on chunking. and which offers broad, cross-linguistic coverage while uniting key aspects of comprehension and production within a single framework. The model's design reflects memory constraints imposed by the real-time nature of language processing, and is inspired by psycholinguistic evidence for children's sensitivity to the distributional properties of multiword sequences and for shallow language comprehension based on local information. It learns from corpora of child-directed speech. chunking incoming words together to incrementally build an item-based ""shallow parse."" When the model encounters an utterance made by the target child, it attempts to generate an identical utterance using the same chunks and statistics involved during comprehension. High performance is achieved on both comprehension- and production-related tasks: the model's shallow parsing is evaluated across 79 single-child corpora spanning English. French, and German, while its production performance is evaluated across over 200 single-child corpora representing 29 languages from the CHIMES database. The model also succeeds in capturing findings from children's production of complex sentence types. Together, our modeling results suggest that much of children's early linguistic behavior may be supported by item-based learning through online processing of simple distributional cues, consistent with the notion that acquisition can be understood as learning to process language."

Most existing work considers a supervised setting, making use of labeled data for both the source and target domains. A disadvantage of such methods is that they cannot train for domains without NER data. To address this issue, we consider using cross-domain LM as a bridge cross-domains for NER domain adaptation, performing cross-domain and cross-task knowledge transfer by designing a novel parameter generation network. Results show that our method can effectively extract domain differences from cross-domain LM contrast, allowing unsupervised domain adaptation while also giving state-of-the-art results among supervised domain adaptation methods.

Due to the limited capability of RNN-based encoder-decoder structure to capture deep and long-range dependencies among words, previous works can hardly generate satisfactory sentences from scratch. When humans convert the sentiment attribute of a sentence, a simple but effective approach is to only replace the original sentimental tokens in the sentence with target sentimental expressions, instead of building a new sentence from scratch. Such a process is very similar to the task of Text Infilling or Cloze, which could be handled by a deep bidirectional Masked Language Model (e.g. BERT). So we propose a two step approach ""Mask and Infill"" In the mask step, we separate style from content by masking the positions of sentimental tokens. In the infill step, we retrofit MLM to Attribute Conditional MLM, to infill the masked positions by predicting words or phrases conditioned on the context' and target sentiment. We evaluate our model on two review datasets with quantitative, qualitative, and human evaluations. Experimental results demonstrate that our models improve state-of-the-art performance."

We release SCIBERT, a pretrained language model based on BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) to address the lack of highquality, large-scale labeled scientific data. SCIBERT leverages unsupervised pretraining on a large multi-domain corpus of scientific publications to improve performance on downstream scientific NLP tasks. We evaluate on a suite of tasks including sequence tagging, sentence classification and dependency parsing, with datasets from a variety of scientific domains. We demonstrate statistically significant improvements over BERT and achieve new state-of-the-art results on several of these tasks.

We propose a novel neural architecture Transformer-XL that enables learning dependency beyond a fixed length without disrupting temporal coherence. It consists of a segment-level recurrence mechanism and a novel positional encoding scheme. Our method not only enables capturing longer-term dependency, but also resolves the context fragmentation problem. As a result, Transformer-XL learns dependency that is 80% longer than RNNs and 450% longer than vanilla Transformers, achieves better performance on both short and long sequences, and is up to 1,800+ times faster than vanilla Transformers during evaluation. Notably, we improve the state-of-the-art results of bpc/perplexity to 0.99 on en-wiki8, 1.08 on text8, 18.3 on WikiText-103, 21.8 on One Billion Word, and 54.5 on Penn Treebank (without finetuning). When trained only on WikiText-103, Transformer-XL manages to generate reasonably coherent, novel text articles with thousands of tokens. Our code, pretrained models, and hyperparameters are available in both Tensorflow and PyTorch(1).

The state-of-the-art methods for relation classification are primarily based on Convolutional or Recurrent Neural Networks. Recently, the pre-trained BERT model achieves very successful results in many NLP classification / sequence labeling tasks. Relation classification differs from those tasks in that it relies on information of both the sentence and the two target entities. In this paper, we propose a model that both leverages the pre-trained BERT language model and incorporates information from the target entities to tackle the relation classification task. We locate the target entities and transfer the information through the pre-trained architecture and incorporate the corresponding encoding of the two entities.

Neural IR models have achieved promising results in learning query-document relevance patterns, but few explorations have been done on understanding the text content of a query or a document. This paper studies leveraging a recently-proposed contextual neural language model, BERT, to provide deeper text understanding for IR. Experimental results demonstrate that the contextual text representations from BERT are more effective than traditional word embeddings. Compared to bag-of-words retrieval models, the contextual language model can better leverage language structures, bringing large improvements on queries written in natural languages. Combining the text understanding ability with search knowledge leads to an enhanced pre-trained BERT model that can benefit related search tasks where training data are limited.

For 26 years, most state-of-the-art approaches combined machine learning and evolutionary information. However, for some applications retrieving related proteins is becoming too time-consuming. Additionally, evolutionary information is less powerful for small families, e.g. for proteins from the Dark Proteome. Both these problems are addressed by the new methodology introduced here. Results: We introduced a novel way to represent protein sequences as continuous vectors (embeddings) by using the language model ELMo taken from natural language processing. By modeling protein sequences, ELMo effectively captured the biophysical properties of the language of life from unlabeled big data (UniRef50). We refer to these new embeddings as SeqVec (Sequence-to-Vector) and demonstrate their effectiveness by training simple neural networks for two different tasks. At the per-residue level, secondary structure (Q3 = 79% +/- 1, Q8 = 68% +/- 1) and regions with intrinsic disorder (MCC = 0.59 +/- 0.03) were predicted significantly better than through one-hot encoding or through Word2veclike approaches. At the per-protein level, subcellular localization was predicted in ten classes (Q10 = 68% +/- 1) and membrane-bound were distinguished from water-soluble proteins (Q2 = 87% +/- 1). Although SeqVec embeddings generated the best predictions from single sequences, no solution improved over the best existing method using evolutionary information. Nevertheless, our approach improved over some popular methods using evolutionary information and for some proteins even did beat the best. Thus, they prove to condense the underlying principles of protein sequences. Overall, the important novelty is speed: where the lightning-fast HHblits needed on average about two minutes to generate the evolutionary information for a target protein, SeqVec created embeddings on average in 0.03 s. As this speed-up is independent of the size of growing sequence databases, SeqVec provides a highly scalable approach for the analysis of big data in proteomics, i.e. microbiome or metaproteome analysis. Conclusion: Transfer-learning succeeded to extract information from unlabeled sequence databases relevant for various protein prediction tasks. SeqVec modeled the language of life, namely the principles underlying protein sequences better than any features suggested by textbooks and prediction methods. The exception is evolutionary information, however, that information is not available on the level of a single sequence.

In this work, we show that contextual embeddings can be used to achieve unprecedented gains in Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) tasks. Our approach focuses on creating sense-level embeddings with full-coverage of WordNet, and without recourse to explicit knowledge of sense distributions or task-specific modelling. As a result, a simple Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) method using our representations is able to consistently surpass the performance of previous systems using powerful neural sequencing models. We also analyse the robustness of our approach when ignoring part-of-speech and lemma features, requiring disambiguation against the full sense inventory, and revealing shortcomings to be improved. Finally, we explore applications of our sense embeddings for concept-level analyses of contextual embeddings and their respective NLMs.	[Loureiro, Daniel; Jorge, Alipio Mario] Univ Porto, Fac Sci, LIAAD, INESC TEC, Porto, Portugal	INESC TEC; Universidade do Porto	Loureiro, D (corresponding author), Univ Porto, Fac Sci, LIAAD, INESC TEC, Porto, Portugal.	dloureiro@fc.up.pt; amjorge@fc.up.pt	Jorge, Al칤pio/A-1721-2008	Jorge, Al칤pio/0000-0002-5475-1382; Loureiro, Daniel/0000-0001-5134-360X	National Funds through the Portuguese funding agency, FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [UID/EEA/50014/2019]	National Funds through the Portuguese funding agency, FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia	This work is financed by National Funds through the Portuguese funding agency, FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia within project: UID/EEA/50014/2019.

We collect human explanations for commonsense reasoning in the form of natural language sequences and highlighted annotations in a new dataset called Common Sense Explanations (CoS-E). We use CoS-E to train language models to automatically generate explanations that can be used during training and inference in a novel Commonsense Auto-Generated Explanation (CAGE) framework. CAGE improves the state-of-the-art by 10% on the challenging CommonsenseQA task. We further study commonsense reasoning in DNNs using both human and auto-generated explanations including transfer to out-of-domain tasks. Empirical results indicate that we can effectively leverage language models for commonsense reasoning.

Therefore, in addition to the difficulty of event extraction itself, insufficient training data hinders the learning process as well. To promote event extraction, we first propose an event extraction model to overcome the roles overlap problem by separating the argument prediction in terms of roles. Moreover, to address the problem of insufficient training data, we propose a method to automatically generate labeled data by editing prototypes and screen out generated samples by ranking the quality. Experiments on the ACE2005 dataset demonstrate that our extraction model can surpass most existing extraction methods. Besides, incorporating our generation method exhibits further significant improvement. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on the event extraction task, including pushing the F1 score of trigger classification to 81.1%, and the F1 score of argument classification to 58.9%.

We, instead, use a masked language modeling objective to train a model to predict any subset of the target words, conditioned on both the input text and a partially masked target translation. This approach allows for efficient iterative decoding, where we first predict all of the target words non-autoregressively, and then repeatedly mask out and regenerate the subset of words that the model is least confident about. By applying this strategy for a constant number of iterations, our model improves state-of-the-art performance levels for non-autoregressive and parallel decoding translation models by over 4 BLEU on average. It is also able to reach within about 1 BLEU point of a typical left-to-right transformer model, while decoding significantly faster.(1)	[Ghazvininejad, Marjan; Levy, Omer; Liu, Yinhan; Zettlemoyer, Luke] Facebook AI Res, Seattle, WA 98101 USA	Facebook Inc	Ghazvininejad, M (corresponding author), Facebook AI Res, Seattle, WA 98101 USA.

Considering that current methods are generally time-consuming due to the dense frame-processing manner, we propose a recurrent neural network based reinforcement learning model which selectively observes a sequence of frames and associates the given sentence with video content in a matching-based manner. However, directly matching sentences with video content performs poorly due to the large visual-semantic discrepancy. Thus, we extend the method to a semantic matching reinforcement learning (SM-RL) model by extracting semantic concepts of videos and then fusing them with global context features.

A large-scale typology could provide excellent guidance for multilingual Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly for languages that suffer from the lack of human labeled resources. We present an extensive literature survey on the use of typological information in the development of NLP techniques. Our survey demonstrates that to date, the use of information in existing typological databases has resulted in consistent but modest improvements in system performance. We show that this is due to both intrinsic limitations of databases (in terms of coverage and feature granularity) and under-utilization of the typological features included in them. We advocate for a new approach that adapts the broad and discrete nature of typological categories to the contextual and continuous nature of machine learning algorithms used in contemporary NLP. In particular, we suggest that such an approach could be facilitated by recent developments in data-driven induction of typological knowledge.

However, traditional language models are only capable of remembering facts seen at training time, and often have difficulty recalling them. To address this, we introduce the knowledge graph language model (KGLM), a neural language model with mechanisms for selecting and copying facts from a knowledge graph that are relevant to the context. These mechanisms enable the model to render information it has never seen before, as well as generate out-of-vocabulary tokens. We also introduce the Linked WikiText-2 dataset,(1) a corpus of annotated text aligned to the Wikidata knowledge graph whose contents (roughly) match the popular WikiText-2 benchmark (Merity et al., 2017). In experiments, we demonstrate that the KGLM achieves significantly better performance than a strong baseline language model. We additionally compare different language models' ability to complete sentences requiring factual knowledge, and show that the KGLM outperforms even very large language models in generating facts.

J	Ettinger, A				Ettinger, Allyson			What BERT Is Not: Lessons from a New Suite of Psycholinguistic Diagnostics for Language Models	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS			English	Article							BRAIN POTENTIALS	Pre-training by language modeling has become a popular and successful approach to NLP tasks, but we have yet to understand exactly what linguistic capacities these pre-training processes confer upon models. In this paper we introduce a suite of diagnostics drawn from human language experiments, which allow us to ask targeted questions about information used by language models for generating predictions in context. As a case study, we apply these diagnostics to the popular BERT model, finding that it can generally distinguish good from bad completions involving shared category or role reversal, albeit with less sensitivity than humans, and it robustly retrieves noun hypernyms, but it struggles with challenging inference and role-based event predictionand, in particular, it shows clear insensitivity to the contextual impacts of negation.

J	Hoi, VN				Vo Ngoc Hoi			Understanding higher education learners' acceptance and use of mobile devices for language learning: A Rasch-based path modeling approach	COMPUTERS & EDUCATION			English	Article						Mobile learning; Teaching/learning strategies; Applications in subject areas; Pedagogical issues; Post-secondary education	TECHNOLOGY ACCEPTANCE; UNIFIED THEORY; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; STUDENTS; TEACHERS; ADOPTION; SYSTEM; UTAUT; USAGE; PERCEPTIONS	The widespread use of mobile devices and the wider coverage of wireless networks offer the educational sectors various alternatives in enhancing learning and teaching. Mobile assisted language learning (MALL) emerges from this trend and draws traction from relevant stakeholders. While much research has been done on the application of mobile technologies in promoting language learning, and the educational practices that foster that learning approach, relatively little empirical evidence has been given to understand the acceptance and use of MALL by higher education learners, particularly in the context of a developing country. This study sought to fill this gap by applying the modified version of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). Survey data from 293 higher education learners from Vietnam were analyzed by the Rasch-based path model. Results indicated the important roles of attitude and performance expectancy in predicting learners' behavior intention and their usage of MALL. Facilitating condition was found to have no direct effect on learners' usage of MALL, representing a departure from the literature. The findings offered implications regarding the use of the UTAUT as an appropriate model for examining MALL acceptance, the improvement of technical and organizational supports, as well as the need for more empirical studies on the instructional approaches that foster the use of MALL, particularly in the context of a developing country like Vietnam.

However, efforts to understand whether LM representations are useful for symbolic reasoning tasks have been limited and scattered. In this work, we propose eight reasoning tasks, which conceptually require operations such as comparison, conjunction, and composition. A fundamental challenge is to understand whether the performance of a LM on a task should be attributed to the pre-trained representations or to the process of fine-tuning on the task data. To address this, we propose an evaluation protocol that includes both zero-shot evaluation (no fine-tuning), as well as comparing the learning curve of a fine-tuned LM to the learning curve of multiple controls, which paints a rich picture of the LM capabilities. Our main findings are that: (a) different LMs exhibit qualitatively different reasoning abilities, e.g., ROBERTA succeeds in reasoning tasks where BERT fails completely; (b) LMs do not reason in an abstract manner and are context-dependent, e.g., while ROBERTA can compare ages, it can do so only when the ages are in the typical range of human ages; (c) On half of our reasoning tasks all models fail completely. Our findings and infrastructure can help future work on designing new datasets, models, and objective functions for pre-training.

We fine-tune and cast EM as a sequence-pair classification problem to leverage such models with a simple architecture. Our experiments show that a straightforward application of language models such as BERT, DistilBERT, or RoBERTa pre-trained on large text corpora already significantly improves the matching quality and outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA), by up to 29% of F1 score on benchmark datasets. We also developed three optimization techniques to further improve Dirro's matching capability. DITTO allows domain knowledge to be injected by highlighting important pieces of input information that may be of interest when making matching decisions. DITTO also summarizes strings that are too long so that only the essential information is retained and used for EM. Finally, DITTO adapts a SOTA technique on data augmentation for text to EM to augment the training data with (difficult) examples. This way, DITTO is forced to learn ""harder"" to improve the model's matching capability. The optimizations we developed further boost the performance of DITTO by up to 9.8%. Perhaps more surprisingly, we establish that DITTO can achieve the previous SOTA results with at most half the number of labeled data. Finally, we demonstrate DITTO'S effectiveness on a real-world large-scale EM task. On matching two company datasets consisting of 789K and 412K records, DITTO achieves a high F1 score of 96.5%."

PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2020 CONFERENCE ON EMPIRICAL METHODS IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (EMNLP)			English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)	NOV 16-20, 2020	ELECTR NETWORK					It has recently been observed that neural language models trained on unstructured text can implicitly store and retrieve knowledge using natural language queries. In this short paper, we measure the practical utility of this approach by fine-tuning pre-trained models to answer questions without access to any external context or knowledge. We show that this approach scales with model size and performs competitively with open-domain systems that explicitly retrieve answers from an external knowledge source when answering questions. To facilitate reproducibility and future work, we release our code and trained models.(1)	[Roberts, Adam; Raffel, Colin; Shazeer, Noam] Google, Mountain View, CA USA	Google Incorporated	Roberts, A (corresponding author), Google, Mountain View, CA USA.	adarob@google.com; craffel@gmail.com; noam@google.com						Asai Akari, 2019, INT C LEARNING REPRE; Berant J., 2013, PROC C EMPIR METHODS, P1533; Bollacker K, 2008, P ACM SIGMOD INT C M, P1247, DOI DOI 10.1145/1376616.1376746; Chen DQ, 2017, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 55TH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS (ACL 2017), VOL 1, P1870, DOI 10.18653/v1/P17-1171; Clark Christopher, 2019, ARXIV190510044; Dai A.

Using this method, we achieved 89.6% accuracy on the test set of the ADReSS (Alzheimer's Dementia Recognition through Spontaneous Speech) Challenge, a considerable improvement over the baseline of 75.0%, established by the organizers of the challenge. The best accuracy was obtained with ERNIE, plus an encoding of pauses. Robustness is a challenge for large models and small training sets. Ensemble over many runs of BERT/ERNIE fine-tuning reduced variance and improved accuracy. We found that um was used much less frequently in Alzheimer's speech, compared to uh. We discussed this interesting finding from linguistic and cognitive perspectives.

However, this knowledge is stored implicitly in the parameters of a neural network, requiring ever-larger networks to cover more facts. terpretable way, we augment language model pre-training with a latent knowledge retriever, which allows the model to retrieve and attend over documents from a large corpus such as Wikipedia, used during pre-training, fine-tuning and inference. For the first time, we show how to pre-train such a knowledge retriever in an unsupervised manner, using masked language modeling as the learning signal and backpropagating through a retrieval step that considers millions of documents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Language Model pre-training (REALM) by fine-tuning on the challenging task of Open-domain Question Answering (Open-QA). We compare against state-of-the-art models for both explicit and implicit knowledge storage on three popular Open-QA benchmarks, and find that we outperform all previous methods by a significant margin (4-16% absolute accuracy), while also providing qualitative benefits such as interpretability and modularity.

Leveraging the huge amount of unlabeled texts nowadays available, they provide an efficient way to pre-train continuous word representations that can be fine-tuned for a downstream task, along with their contextualization at the sentence level. This has been widely demonstrated for English using contextualized representations (Dai and Le, 2015; Peters et al., 2018; Howard and Ruder, 2018; Radford et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019b). In this paper, we introduce and share FlauBERT, a model learned on a very large and heterogeneous French corpus. Models of different sizes are trained using the new CNRS (French National Centre for Scientific Research) Jean Zay supercomputer. We apply our French language models to diverse NLP tasks (text classification, paraphrasing, natural language inference, parsing, word sense disambiguation) and show that most of the time they outperform other pre-training approaches. Different versions of FlauBERT as well as a unified evaluation protocol for the downstream tasks, called FLUE (French Language Understanding Evaluation), are shared to the research community for further reproducible experiments in French NLP.

Reformulating tasks as fill-in-the-blanks problems (e.g., cloze tests) is a natural approach for gauging such knowledge, however, its usage is limited by the manual effort and guesswork required to write suitable prompts. To address this, we develop AUTOPROMPT, an automated method to create prompts for a diverse set of tasks, based on a gradient-guided search. Using AUTOPROMPT, we show that masked language models (MLMs) have an inherent capability to perform sentiment analysis and natural language inference without additional parameters or finetuning, sometimes achieving performance on par with recent state-of-the-art supervised models. We also show that our prompts elicit more accurate factual knowledge from MLMs than the manually created prompts on the LAMA benchmark, and that MLMs can be used as relation extractors more effectively than supervised relation extraction models. These results demonstrate that automatically generated prompts are a viable parameter-free alternative to existing probing methods, and as pretrained LMs become more sophisticated and capable, potentially a replacement for finetuning.

Our BERTweet, having the same architecture as BERTbase (Devlin et al., 2019), is trained using the RoBERTa pre-training procedure (Liu et al., 2019). Experiments show that BERTweet outperforms strong baselines RoBERTa(base) and XLM-R-base (Conneau et al., 2020), producing better performance results than the previous state-of-the-art models on three Tweet NLP tasks: Part-of-speech tagging, Named-entity recognition and text classification.

With the progress in natural language processing (NLP), extracting valuable information from biomedical literature has gained popularity among researchers, and deep learning has boosted the development of effective biomedical text mining models. However, directly applying the advancements in NLP to biomedical text mining often yields unsatisfactory results due to a word distribution shift from general domain corpora to biomedical corpora. In this article, we investigate how the recently introduced pre-trained language model BERT can be adapted for biomedical corpora. Results: We introduce BioBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining), which is a domain-specific language representation model pre-trained on large-scale biomedical corpora. With almost the same architecture across tasks, BioBERT largely outperforms BERT and previous state-of-the-art models in a variety of biomedical text mining tasks when pre-trained on biomedical corpora. While BERT obtains performance comparable to that of previous state-of-the-art models, BioBERT significantly outperforms them on the following three representative biomedical text mining tasks: biomedical named entity recognition (0.62% F1 score improvement), biomedical relation extraction (2.80% F1 score improvement) and biomedical question answering (12.24% MRR improvement). Our analysis results show that pre-training BERT on biomedical corpora helps it to understand complex biomedical texts.

Over the past few years, the progress of Natural Language Processing (NLP) based on deep learning advanced rapidly. Significant progress has been made with deep learning showing promising results on financial text mining models. However, as NLP models require large amounts of labeled training data, applying deep learning to financial text mining is often unsuccessful due to the lack of labeled training data in financial fields. To address this issue, we present FinBERT (BERT for Financial Text Mining) that is a domain specific language model pre-trained on large-scale financial corpora. In FinBERT, different from BERT, we construct six pre-training tasks covering more knowledge, simultaneously trained on general corpora and financial domain corpora, which can enable FinBERT model better to capture language knowledge and semantic information. The results show that our FinBERT outperforms all current state-of-the-art models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of FinBERT. The source code and pre-trained models of FinBERT are available online.

J	Ambridge, B				Ambridge, Ben			Against stored abstractions: A radical exemplar model of language acquisition	FIRST LANGUAGE			English	Article						Abstraction; child language acquisition; construction; exemplar account; instance-based; memory-based; morphology; n-grams; phonology; syntax; word meaning	ENGLISH PAST-TENSE; CHILDRENS ACQUISITION; ARGUMENT-STRUCTURE; NEIGHBORHOOD DENSITY; CONNECTIONIST MODEL; ELICITED-PRODUCTION; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; LINKING ELEMENTS; INPUT FREQUENCY; WORD SEQUENCES	The goal of this article is to make the case for a radical exemplar account of child language acquisition, under which unwitnessed forms are produced and comprehended by on-the-fly analogy across multiple stored exemplars, weighted by their degree of similarity to the target with regard to the task at hand. Across the domains of (1) word meanings, (2) morphologically inflected words, (3) n-grams, (4) sentence-level constructions and (5) phonetics and phonology, accounts based on independently-represented abstractions (whether formal rules or prototype categories) fail for two reasons. First, it is not possible to posit abstractions that delineate possible and impossible form; e.g. that (1) rule in pool tables and data tables, but rule out chairs, (2) rule in the past-tense forms netted and bet but rule out *setted and *jet, (3) rule in the bigram f+t but rule out (probabilistically) v+t, (4) rule in both John feared Bill and John frightened Bill but rule out *John laughed Bill, (5) rule in Speaker A but rule out Speaker B as the person who produced a particular word (e.g. Sa'urday). Second, for each domain, empirical data provide evidence of exemplar storage that cannot be captured by putative abstractions: e.g. speakers prefer and/or show an advantage for (1) exemplar variation even within word-meaning 'category boundaries', (2) novel inflected forms that are similar to existing exemplars, (3) n-grams that have occurred frequently in the input, (4) SVO sentences with he as SUBJECT and it as OBJECT and (5) repeated productions of 'the same' word that are phonologically similar or, better still, identical. An exemplar account avoids an intractable lumping-or-splitting dilemma facing abstraction-based accounts and provides a unitary explanation of language acquisition across all domains; one that is consistent with models and empirical findings from the computational modelling and neuroimaging literature.

CrowS-Pairs: A Challenge Dataset for Measuring Social Biases in Masked Language Models	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2020 CONFERENCE ON EMPIRICAL METHODS IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (EMNLP)			English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)	NOV 16-20, 2020	ELECTR NETWORK					Warning: This paper contains explicit statements of offensive stereotypes and may be upsetting. Pretrained language models, especially masked language models (MLMs) have seen success across many NLP tasks. However, there is ample evidence that they use the cultural biases that are undoubtedly present in the corpora they are trained on, implicitly creating harm with biased representations. To measure some forms of social bias in language models against protected demographic groups in the US, we introduce the Crowdsourced Stereotype Pairs benchmark (CrowS-Pairs). CrowS-Pairs has 1508 examples that cover stereotypes dealing with nine types of bias, like race, religion, and age. In CrowS-Pairs a model is presented with two sentences: one that is more stereotyping and another that is less stereotyping. The data focuses on stereotypes about historically disadvantaged groups and contrasts them with advantaged groups. We find that all three of the widely-used MLMs we evaluate substantially favor sentences that express stereotypes in every category in CrowS-Pairs. As work on building less biased models advances, this dataset can be used as a benchmark to evaluate progress.

Recently, deep transfer-learning methods have been applied successfully to a myriad of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, including ATSC. Building on top of the prominent BERT language model, we approach ATSC using a two-step procedure: self-supervised domain-specific BERT language model finetuning, followed by supervised task-specific finetuning. Our findings on how to best exploit domain-specific language model finetuning enable us to produce new state-of-the-art performance on the SemEval 2014 Task 4 restaurants dataset. In addition, to explore the real-world robustness of our models, we perform cross-domain evaluation. We show that a cross-domain adapted BERT language model performs significantly better than strong baseline models like vanilla BERT-base and XLNet-base. Finally, we conduct a case study to interpret model prediction errors.

J	Lee, JS; Hsiang, J				Lee, Jieh-Sheng; Hsiang, Jieh			Patent classification by fine-tuning BERT language model	WORLD PATENT INFORMATION			English	Article								In this work we focus on fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model and applying it to patent classification. When applied to large datasets of over two million patents, our approach outperforms the state of the art by an approach using CNN with word embeddings. Besides, we focus on patent claims without other parts in patent documents. Our contributions include: (1) a new state-of-the-art result based on pre-trained BERT model and fine-tuning for patent classification, (2) a large dataset USPTO-3M at the CPC subclass level with SQL statements that can be used by future researchers, (3) showing that patent claims alone are sufficient to achieve state-of-the-art results for classification task, in contrast to conventional wisdom.

In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of PTMs for NLP. We first briefly introduce language representation learning and its research progress. Then we systematically categorize existing PTMs based on a taxonomy from four different perspectives. Next, we describe how to adapt the knowledge of PTMs to downstream tasks. Finally, we outline some potential directions of PTMs for future research. This survey is purposed to be a hands-on guide for understanding, using, and developing PTMs for various NLP tasks.

J	Zhang, WE; Sheng, QZ; Alhazmi, A; Li, CL				Zhang, Wei Emma; Sheng, Quan Z.; Alhazmi, Ahoud; Li, Chenliang			Adversarial Attacks on Deep-learning Models in Natural Language Processing: A Survey	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Deep neural networks; adversarial examples; textual data; natural language processing		With the development of high computational devices, deep neural networks (DNNs), in recent years, have gained significant popularity in many Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. However, previous efforts have shown that DNNs are vulnerable to strategically modified samples, named adversarial examples. These samples are generated with some imperceptible perturbations, but can fool the DNNs to give false predictions. Inspired by the popularity of generating adversarial examples against DNNs in Computer Vision (CV), research efforts on attacking DNNs for Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications have emerged in recent years. However, the intrinsic difference between image (CV) and text (NLP) renders challenges to directly apply attacking methods in CV to NLP. Various methods are proposed addressing this difference and attack a wide range of NLP applications. In this article, we present a systematic survey on these works. We collect all related academic works since the first appearance in 2017. We then select, summarize, discuss, and analyze 40 representative works in a comprehensive way. To make the article self-contained, we cover preliminary knowledge of NLP and discuss related seminal works in computer vision. We conclude our survey with a discussion on open issues to bridge the gap between the existing progress and more robust adversarial attacks on NLP DNNs.

However, the sentence embeddings from the pre-trained language models without fine-tuning have been found to poorly capture semantic meaning of sentences. In this paper, we argue that the semantic information in the BERT embeddings is not fully exploited. We first reveal the theoretical connection between the masked language model pre-training objective and the semantic similarity task theoretically, and then analyze the BERT sentence embeddings empirically. We find that BERT always induces a non-smooth anisotropic semantic space of sentences, which harms its performance of semantic similarity. To address this issue, we propose to transform the anisotropic sentence embedding distribution to a smooth and isotropic Gaussian distribution through normalizing flows that are learned with an unsupervised objective.

TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS			English	Article								"Recent work has presented intriguing results examining the knowledge contained in language models (LMs) by having the LM fill in the blanks of prompts such as ""Obama is a _ by profession''. These prompts are usually manually created, and quite possibly sub-optimal; another prompt such as ""Obama worked as a_'' may result in more accurately predicting the correct profession. Because of this, given an inappropriate prompt, we might fail to retrieve facts that the LM does know, and thus any given prompt only provides a lower bound estimate of the knowledge contained in an LM. In this paper, we attempt to more accurately estimate the knowledge contained in LMs by automatically discovering better prompts to use in this querying process. Specifically, we propose mining-based and paraphrasing-based methods to automatically generate high-quality and diverse prompts, as well as ensemble methods to combine answers from different prompts. Extensive experiments on the LAMA benchmark for extracting relational knowledge from LMs demonstrate that our methods can improve accuracy from 31.1% to 39.6%, providing a tighter lower bound on what LMs know. We have released the code and the resulting LM Prompt And Query Archive (LPAQA) at https://github.com/jzbjyb/LPAQA."

Given an input text with masked tokens, we rely on conventional masks to learn inter-relations between corrupted tokens and context via autoencoding, and pseudo masks to learn intra-relations between masked spans via partially autoregressive modeling. With well-designed position embeddings and self-attention masks, the context encodings are reused to avoid redundant computation. Moreover, conventional masks used for autoencoding provide global masking information, so that all the position embeddings are accessible in partially autoregressive language modeling. In addition, the two tasks pre-train a unified language model as a bidirectional encoder and a sequence-to-sequence decoder, respectively. Our experiments show that the unified language models pre-trained using PMLM achieve new state-of-the-art results on a wide range of language understanding and generation tasks across several widely used benchmarks.

Instead, we evaluate MLMs out of the box via their pseudo-log-likelihood scores (PLLs), which are computed by masking tokens one by one. We show that PLLs outperform scores from autoregressive language models like GPT-2 in a variety of tasks. By rescoring ASR and NMT hypotheses, RoBERTa reduces an end-to-end LibriSpeech model's WER by 30% relative and adds up to +1.7 BLEU on state-of-the-art baselines for low-resource translation pairs, with further gains from domain adaptation. We attribute this success to PLL's unsupervised expression of linguistic acceptability without a left-to-right bias, greatly improving on scores from GPT-2 (+10 points on island effects, NPI licensing in BLiMP). One can finetune MLMs to give scores without masking, enabling computation in a single inference pass. In all, PLLs and their associated pseudo-perplexities (PPPLs) enable plug-and-play use of the growing number of pretrained MLMs; e.g., we use a single cross-lingual model to rescore translations in multiple languages. We release our library for language model scoring at https: //github.com/awslabs/mlm-scoring.

While considerable work has gone into developing and evaluating pedagogies for digital multimodal composing, one underresearched area is that of assessment. Given that the primary goal of digital multimodal composing is to develop competencies in multiple modes (including language) the question here is how to reflect this goal in the design of appropriate assessment criteria. In particular, teachers and researchers need to establish what dimensions of multimodal communicative competence to assess and how. In this paper, we present a case study of a university English for science course in which one of the assignments is a digital video scientific documentary. The study draws on interviews with teachers in order to determine how they conceive of the multimodal assessment task, including practical issues as well as challenges faced. The article proposes a process-based model for the assessment of digital multimodal composing, which shows how processes of instruction, design activity and assessment interact. Assessment can be planned at different stages of the design activity, draw on formative and summative strategies, and must take into account the orchestration of multimodal affordances.

Many state-of-the-art models are first pre-trained on a large text corpus and then fine-tuned on downstream tasks. However, due to limited data resources from downstream tasks and the extremely high complexity of pre-trained models, aggressive fine-tuning often causes the fine-tuned model to overfit the training data of downstream tasks and fail to generalize to unseen data. To address such an issue in a principled manner, we propose a new learning framework for robust and efficient fine-tuning for pre-trained models to attain better generalization performance. The proposed framework contains two important ingredients: 1. Smoothness-inducing regularization, which effectively manages the complexity of the model; 2. Bregman proximal point optimization, which is an instance of trustregion methods and can prevent aggressive updating. Our experiments show that the proposed framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance on a number of NLP tasks including GLUE, SNLI, SciTail and ANLI. Moreover, it also outperforms the state-of-the-art T5 model, which is the largest pre-trained model containing 11 billion parameters, on GLUE.

Successfully applying Industry 4.0 requires the cooperation of various stakeholders from different domains. Domain-specific modeling languages promise to facilitate their involvement through leveraging (domain-specific) models to primary development artifacts. We aim to assess the use of modeling in Industry 4.0 through the lens of modeling languages in a broad sense. Based on an extensive literature review, we updated our systematic mapping study on modeling languages and modeling techniques used in Industry 4.0 (Wortmann et al., Conference on model-driven engineering languages and systems (MOD-ELS'17), IEEE, pp 281-291, 2017) to include publications until February 2018. Overall, the updated study considers 3344 candidate publications that were systematically investigated until 408 relevant publications were identified. Based on these, we developed an updated map of the research landscape on modeling languages and techniques for Industry 4.0. Research on modeling languages in Industry 4.0 focuses on contributing methods to solve the challenges of digital representation and integration. To this end, languages from systems engineering and knowledge representation are applied most often but rarely combined. There also is a gap between the communities researching and applying modeling languages for Industry 4.0 that originates from different perspectives on modeling and related standards. From the vantage point of modeling, Industry 4.0 is the combination of systems engineering, with cyber-physical systems, and knowledge engineering. Research currently is splintered along topics and communities and accelerating progress demands for multi-disciplinary, integrated research efforts.

J	Kim, YSG				Kim, Young-Suk Grace			Hierarchical and Dynamic Relations of Language and Cognitive Skills to Reading Comprehension: Testing the Direct and Indirect Effects Model of Reading (DIER)	JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						DIER; dynamic relations; hierarchical relations; reading comprehension	CHILDRENS INFERENCE GENERATION; WORKING-MEMORY; SIMPLE VIEW; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; MORPHOLOGICAL AWARENESS; LISTENING COMPREHENSION; DEVELOPMENTAL RELATIONS; VOCABULARY ACQUISITION; TEXT COMPREHENSION; INHIBITORY CONTROL	We investigated 2 hypotheses of a recently proposed integrative theoretical model of reading, the direct and indirect effects model of reading (DIER; Kim, 2017b, 2019): (a) hierarchical relations and (b) dynamic relations (or differential relations) of skills to reading comprehension. Students were assessed on reading comprehension, word reading, listening comprehension, working memory, attention, vocabulary, grammatical knowledge, perspective taking (theory of mind), knowledge-based inference, and comprehension monitoring in Grade 2 and again in Grade 4. Structural equation model results supported the hierarchical relations hypothesis of DIER. When a nonhierarchical, direct relations model was fitted, primarily the upper level skills (i.e., word reading and listening comprehension) were statistically significant. When hierarchical, direct, and indirect relations models were fitted, lower level skills (e.g., working memory, vocabulary) and higher order cognitive skills (e.g., perspective taking) were indirectly related to reading comprehension via multiple pathways, whereas word reading and listening comprehension remained directly related to reading comprehension. Furthermore, the magnitudes of relations varied in Grade 2 versus Grade 4 such that perspective taking (as measured by theory of mind), vocabulary, and working memory had larger effects whereas comprehension monitoring and grammatical knowledge had smaller effects on reading comprehension in Grade 4 than in Grade 2. These results provide some support for the dynamic relations hypothesis of DIER, but also suggest the complex nature of the dynamic relations as a function of development and text characteristics.

J	Kremmel, B; Harding, L				Kremmel, Benjamin; Harding, Luke			Towards a Comprehensive, Empirical Model of Language Assessment Literacy across Stakeholder Groups: Developing the Language Assessment Literacy Survey	LANGUAGE ASSESSMENT QUARTERLY			English	Article							ASSESSMENT-KNOWLEDGE	While scholars have proposed different models of language assessment literacy (LAL), these models have mostly comprised prescribed sets of components based on principles of good practice. As such, these models remain theoretical in nature, and represent the perspectives of language assessment researchers rather than stakeholders themselves. The project from which the current study is drawn was designed to address this issue through an empirical investigation of the LAL needs of different stakeholder groups. Central to this aim was the development of a rigorous and comprehensive survey which would illuminate the dimensionality of LAL and generate profiles of needs across these dimensions. This paper reports on the development of an instrument designed for this purpose: the Language Assessment Literacy Survey. We first describe the expert review and pretesting stages of survey development. Then we report on the results of an exploratory factor analysis based on data from a large-scale administration (N = 1086), where respondents from a range of stakeholder groups across the world judged the LAL needs of their peers. Finally, selected results from the large-scale administration are presented to illustrate the survey's utility, specifically comparing the responses of language teachers, language testing/assessment developers and language testing/assessment researchers.

J	Alfadda, HA; Mahdi, HS				Alfadda, Hind Abdulaziz; Mahdi, Hassan Saleh			Measuring Students' Use of Zoom Application in Language Course Based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)	JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLINGUISTIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Technology acceptance model; Language learning; Attitudes; Zoom; Gender; Experience	COMPUTER SELF-EFFICACY; BEHAVIORAL INTENTION; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; THEORETICAL EXTENSION; HIGHER-EDUCATION; PERCEIVED EASE; ATTITUDES; TEACHERS; MOTIVATION; INTERNET	The study uses technology acceptance model (TAM) to gain insights into user reactions to the technology adopted for language learning. The study aims to analyze the correlation between the variables of TAM on using Zoom application in language learning, in addition to examining how gender and experience influence the use of technology. The participants of this study comprise of 75 undergraduate English-as-Foreign-Language learners who have studied for their courses online during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of the study reveal a strong positive correlation between the actual use of Zoom and the students' attitudes and behavioral intention. In addition, there is a positive correlation between computer self-efficacy and other variables (i.e. PU, actual use, PEU, attitude and behavioral intention). Further, while the results reveal that there is no correlation between the gender and any variables of the model, it has been found that experience is positively correlated with the variables of TAM.

A Term Weighted Neural Language Model and Stacked Bidirectional LSTM Based Framework for Sarcasm Identification	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Task analysis; Social networking (online); Blogs; Long short term memory; Predictive models; Gravity; Analytical models; Sarcasm identification; term weighting; neural language model; bidirectional long shortterm memory	SENTIMENT ANALYSIS	Sarcasm identification on text documents is one of the most challenging tasks in natural language processing (NLP), has become an essential research direction, due to its prevalence on social media data. The purpose of our research is to present an effective sarcasm identification framework on social media data by pursuing the paradigms of neural language models and deep neural networks. To represent text documents, we introduce inverse gravity moment based term weighted word embedding model with trigrams. In this way, critical words/terms have higher values by keeping the word-ordering information. In our model, we present a three-layer stacked bidirectional long short-term memory architecture to identify sarcastic text documents. For the evaluation task, the presented framework has been evaluated on three-sarcasm identification corpus. In the empirical analysis, three neural language models (i.e., word2vec, fastText and GloVe), two unsupervised term weighting functions (i.e., term-frequency, and TF-IDF) and eight supervised term weighting functions (i.e., odds ratio, relevance frequency, balanced distributional concentration, inverse question frequency-question frequency-inverse category frequency, short text weighting, inverse gravity moment, regularized entropy and inverse false negative-true positive-inverse category frequency) have been evaluated. For sarcasm identification task, the presented model yields promising results with a classification accuracy of 95.30%.

Gene regulatory code is highly complex due to the existence of polysemy and distant semantic relationship, which previous informatics methods often fail to capture especially in data-scarce scenarios. Results: To address this challenge, we developed a novel pre-trained bidirectional encoder representation, named DNABERT, to capture global and transferrable understanding of genomic DNA sequences based on up and downstream nucleotide contexts. We compared DNABERT to the most widely used programs for genome-wide regulatory elements prediction and demonstrate its ease of use, accuracy and efficiency. We show that the single pre-trained transformers model can simultaneously achieve state-of-the-art performance on prediction of promoters, splice sites and transcription factor binding sites, after easy fine-tuning using small task-specific labeled data. Further, DNABERT enables direct visualization of nucleotide-level importance and semantic relationship within input sequences for better interpretability and accurate identification of conserved sequence motifs and functional genetic variant candidates. Finally, we demonstrate that pre-trained DNABERT with human genome can even be readily applied to other organisms with exceptional performance.

In contrast, knowledge embedding (KE) methods can effectively represent the relational facts in knowledge graphs (KGs) with informative entity embeddings, but conventional KE models cannot take full advantage of the abundant textual information. In this paper, we propose a unified model for Knowledge Embedding and Pre-trained LanguagE Representation (KEPLER), which can not only better integrate factual knowledge into PLMs but also produce effective text-enhanced KE with the strong PLMs. In KEPLER, we encode textual entity descriptions with a PLM as their embeddings, and then jointly optimize the KE and language modeling objectives. Experimental results show that KEPLER achieves state-of-the-art performances on various NLP tasks, and also works remarkably well as an inductive KE model on KG link prediction. Furthermore, for pre-training and evaluating KEPLER, we construct Wikidata5M(1), a large-scale KG dataset with aligned entity descriptions, and benchmark state-of-the-art KE methods on it. It shall serve as a new KE benchmark and facilitate the research on large KG, inductive KE, and KG with text. The source code can be obtained from https://github.com/THU-KEG/KEPLER.

Comparing pre-trained language models for Spanish hate speech detection	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Hate speech; Transfer learning; BERT; BETO; Natural language processing; Text classification		Nowadays, due to the great uncontrolled content posted daily on the Web, there has also been a huge increase in the dissemination of hate speech worldwide. Social media, blogs and community forums are examples where people are freely allowed to communicate. However, freedom of expression is not always respectful since offensive or insulting language is sometimes used. Social media companies often rely on users and content moderators to report on this type of content. Nevertheless, due to the large amount of content generated every day on the Web, automatic systems based on Natural Language Processing techniques are required for identifying abusive language online. To date, most of the systems developed to combat this problem are mainly focused on English content, but this issue is a worldwide concern and therefore other languages such as Spanish are involved. In this paper, we address the task of Spanish hate speech identification on social media and provide a deeper understanding of the capabilities of new techniques based on machine learning. In particular, we compare the performance of Deep Learning methods with recently pre-trained language models based on Transfer Learning as well as with traditional machine learning models. Our main contribution is the achievement of promising results in Spanish by applying multilingual and monolingual pre-trained language models such as BERT, XLM and BETO.

[2016. 'Foreign language enjoyment and foreign language classroom anxiety: The right and left feet of the language learner.' In Positive psychology in SLA, edited by T. Gregersen, P. D. MacIntyre, and S. Mercer, 215-236. Bristol: Multilingual Matters] asserted that foreign language classroom anxiety (FLCA) and foreign language enjoyment (FLE) are the learners' metaphorical left and right feet on their journey to acquiring the foreign language. The purpose of this longitudinal study was to investigate the growth as well as changing trends of university students' FLE and FLCA in a course of general English using latent growth curve modeling (LGCM) as well as a triangulation of data collection. To do this, we analyzed data collected from 367 undergraduate students during a semester in a course of general English in the LGCM phase and four participants in the qualitative phase. The findings indicated that while the participants' FLE increased significantly, their level of FLCA decreased during the semester. However, the significance of the intercept and slope variances for both variables implied heterogeneity in the participants' growth in FLE and FLCA over the semester. In addition, the initial levels of both FLE and FLCA could not predict their growth during the semester. Furthermore, at the beginning of the semester, the significant negative correlation between students' FLE and FLCA was low but during the semester the negative correlation between the two variables turned out to be high; however, the qualitative findings indicated moments of experiencing high levels of FLE and FLCA and moments of going through low levels of FLE and FLCA at the same time by the learners. The pedagogical implications of the findings are discussed.

Compared to the most widely used bottom-up and top-down model [2], the new model is bigger, better-designed for VL tasks, and pretrained on much larger training corpora that combine multiple public annotated object detection datasets. Therefore, it can generate representations of a richer collection of visual objects and concepts. While previous VL research focuses mainly on improving the vision-language fusion model and leaves the object detection model improvement untouched, we show that visual features matter significantly in VL models. In our experiments we feed the visual features generated by the new object detection model into a Transformer-based VL fusion model OSCAR [20], and utilize an improved approach OSCAR+ to pre-train the VL model and fine-tune it on a wide range of downstream VL tasks.

However, enormous amounts of compute are required for training and applying such big models, resulting in a large carbon footprint and making it difficult for researchers and practitioners to use them. We show that performance similar to GPT-3 can be obtained with language models that are much ""greener"" in that their parameter count is several orders of magnitude smaller. This is achieved by converting textual inputs into doze questions that contain a task description, combined with gradient-based optimization; exploiting unlabeled data gives further improvements. We identify key factors required for successful natural language understanding with small language models."

However, how to effectively model linguistic rules in end-to-end deep networks remains a research challenge. In this paper, we argue that the limited capacity of language models comes from: 1) implicitly language modeling; 2) unidirectional feature representation; and 3) language model with noise input. Correspondingly, we propose an autonomous, bidirectional and iterative ABINet for scene text recognition. Firstly, the autonomous suggests to block gradient flow between vision and language models to enforce explicitly language modeling. Secondly, a novel bidirectional doze network (BCN) as the language model is proposed based on bidirectional feature representation. Thirdly, we propose an execution manner of iterative correction for language model which can effectively alleviate the impact of noise input. Additionally, based on the ensemble of iterative predictions, we propose a self-training method which can learn from unlabeled images effectively. Extensive experiments indicate that ABINet has superiority on low-quality images and achieves state-of-the-art results on several mainstream benchmarks. Besides, the ABINet trained with ensemble self-training shows promising improvement in realizing human-level recognition.

This restricted form of supervision limits their generality and usability since additional labeled data is needed to specify any other visual concept. Learning directly from raw text about images is a promising alternative which leverages a much broader source of supervision. We demonstrate that the simple pre-training task of predicting which caption goes with which image is an efficient and scalable way to learn SOTA image representations from scratch on a dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the internet. After pre-training, natural language is used to reference learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling zero-shot transfer of the model to downstream tasks. We study performance on over 30 different computer vision datasets, spanning tasks such as OCR, action recognition in videos, geo-localization, and many types of fine-grained object classification. The model transfers nontrivially to most tasks and is often competitive with a fully supervised baseline without the need for any dataset specific training. For instance, we match the accuracy of the original ResNet50 on ImageNet zero-shot without needing to use any of the 1.28 million training examples it was trained on. We release our code and pre-trained model weights at https://github.com/OpenAI/CLIP.

By revealing trends across models, this approach yields novel insights into cognitive and neural mechanisms in the target domain. We here present a systematic study taking this approach to higher-level cognition: human language processing, our species' signature cognitive skill. We find that the most powerful ""transformer"" models predict nearly 100% of explainable variance in neural responses to sentences and generalize across different datasets and imaging modalities (functional MRI and electrocorticography). Models' neural fits (""brain score"") and fits to behavioral responses are both strongly correlated with model accuracy on the next-word prediction task (but not other language tasks). Model architecture appears to substantially contribute to neural fit. These results provide computationally explicit evidence that predictive processing fundamentally shapes the language comprehension mechanisms in the human brain."

J	Li, HL; Pang, YH; Liu, B				Li, Hong-Liang; Pang, Yi-He; Liu, Bin			BioSeq-BLM: a platform for analyzing DNA, RNA and protein sequences based on biological language models	NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH			English	Article							SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; BINDING PROTEINS; WEB SERVER; PREDICTION; CLASSIFICATION; PACKAGE; AUTOCORRELATION; COVARIANCE; DATABASE; PROGRESS	In order to uncover the meanings of 'book of life', 155 different biological language models (BLMs) for DNA, RNA and protein sequence analysis are discussed in this study, which are able to extract the linguistic properties of 'book of life'. We also extend the BLMs into a system called BioSeq-BLM for automatically representing and analyzing the sequence data. Experimental results show that the predictors generated by BioSeq-BLM achieve comparable or even obviously better performance than the exiting state-of-the-art predictors published in literatures, indicating that BioSeq-BLM will provide new approaches for biological sequence analysis based on natural language processing technologies, and contribute to the development of this very important field. In order to help the readers to use BioSeq-BLM for their own experiments, the corresponding web server and stand-alone package are established and released, which can be freely accessed at http: //bliulab.net/BioSeq-BLIW.

This paper demonstrates that in such settings, an adversary can perform a training data extraction attack to recover individual training examples by querying the language model. We demonstrate our attack on GPT-2, a language model trained on scrapes of the public Internet, and are able to extract hundreds of verbatim text sequences from the model's training data. These extracted examples include (public) personally identifiable information (names, phone numbers, and email addresses), IRC conversations, code, and 128-bit UUIDs. Our attack is possible even though each of the above sequences are included in just one document in the training data. We comprehensively evaluate our extraction attack to understand the factors that contribute to its success. Worryingly, we find that larger models are more vulnerable than smaller models. We conclude by drawing lessons and discussing possible safeguards for training large language models.

Inspired by their findings, we study few-shot learning in a more practical scenario, where we use smaller language models for which fine-tuning is computationally efficient. We present LM-BFF-better few-shot fine-tuning of language models1-a suite of simple and complementary techniques for fine-tuning language models on a small number of annotated examples. Our approach includes (1) prompt-based fine-tuning together with a novel pipeline for automating prompt generation; and (2) a refined strategy for dynamically and selectively incorporating demonstrations into each context. Finally, we present a systematic evaluation for analyzing few-shot performance on a range of NLP tasks, including classification and regression. Our experiments demonstrate that our methods combine to dramatically outperform standard fine-tuning procedures in this low resource setting, achieving up to 30% absolute improvement, and 11% on average across all tasks. Our approach makes minimal assumptions on task resources and domain expertise, and hence constitutes a strong task-agnostic method for few-shot learning.(2)	[Gao, Tianyu; Chen, Danqi] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Fisch, Adam] MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA	Princeton University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)	Gao, TY (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.	tianyug@cs.princeton.edu; fisch@csail.mit.edu; danqic@cs.princeton.edu			Princeton University; NSF Graduate Research Fellowship; Google Research Scholar Award	Princeton University(Princeton University); NSF Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Google Research Scholar Award	We thank the members of Princeton, MIT, Tsinghua NLP groups and the anonymous reviewers for their valuable feedback.

Thanks to the recent advances of deep learning, NLP applications have received an unprecedented boost in performance. In this paper, we present a survey of the application of deep learning techniques in NLP, with a focus on the various tasks where deep learning is demonstrating stronger impact. Additionally, we explore, describe, and revise the main resources in NLP research, including software, hardware, and popular corpora. Finally, we emphasize the main limits of deep learning in NLP and current research directions. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SPs can be predicted from sequence data, but existing algorithms are unable to detect all known types of SPs. We introduce SignalP 6.0, a machine learning model that detects all five SP types and is applicable to metagenomic data. A new version of SignalP predicts all types of signal peptides.

AlphaFold2 and related computational systems predict protein structure using deep learning and co-evolutionary relationships encoded in multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). Despite high prediction accuracy achieved by these systems, challenges remain in (1) prediction of orphan and rapidly evolving proteins for which an MSA cannot be generated; (2) rapid exploration of designed structures; and (3) understanding the rules governing spontaneous polypeptide folding in solution. Here we report development of an end-to-end differentiable recurrent geometric network (RGN) that uses a protein language model (AminoBERT) to learn latent structural information from unaligned proteins. A linked geometric module compactly represents C-alpha backbone geometry in a translationally and rotationally invariant way. On average, RGN2 outperforms AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAFold on orphan proteins and classes of designed proteins while achieving up to a 10(6)-fold reduction in compute time. These findings demonstrate the practical and theoretical strengths of protein language models relative to MSAs in structure prediction.

Here, we propose an update to the popular tool DeepLoc with multi-localization prediction and improvements in both performance and interpretability. For training and validation, we curate eukaryotic and human multi-location protein datasets with stringent homology partitioning and enriched with sorting signal information compiled from the literature. We achieve state-of-the-art performance in DeepLoc 2.0 by using a pre-trained protein language model. It has the further advantage that it uses sequence input rather than relying on slower protein profiles. We provide two means of better interpretability: an attention output along the sequence and highly accurate prediction of nine different types of protein sorting signals. We find that the attention output correlates well with the position of sorting signals. The webserver is available at services.healthtech.dtu.dk/service.php?DeepLoc-2.0.
